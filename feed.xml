&lt;p>What exactly happened, why is this incident so explosive, and what can you learn from it to better protect your own data?&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="text-center">
&lt;img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src="https://staging.cryptomator.org/img/blog/onedrive-security-breach.png" alt="OneDrive Security Breach Shows: Why Zero-Knowledge Matters" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="what-went-wrong-with-onedrive-file-picker">What Went Wrong With OneDrive File Picker?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>OneDrive File Picker is a popular interface that allows apps to access files from personal cloud storage. However, Oasis Security discovered that &lt;strong>certain configuration&lt;/strong> errors allowed applications to view and download files that they did not officially have access to – even sensitive content such as tax documents, project plans, or confidential meeting minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worse still, the affected applications did not even need to use an exploit – all they had to do was use the File Picker correctly (or rather, incorrectly). &lt;strong>The problem was not a targeted hack, but a design flaw in the system.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-real-lesson-trust-is-not-a-security-concept">The Real Lesson: Trust Is Not a Security Concept&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Many users trust cloud providers such as Microsoft, Google, and Apple to keep their data secure. But this incident shows that even large platforms make mistakes—with far-reaching consequences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>real problem&lt;/strong> runs deeper:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Access rights&lt;/strong> are managed in the backend, not by the user(s) themselves.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Files are often stored &lt;strong>unencrypted&lt;/strong> on servers—or only with a key that the provider itself controls.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Security vulnerabilities in third-party apps or web interfaces&lt;/strong> can be exploited without those affected even noticing.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>In short&lt;/strong>: anyone who entrusts their data exclusively to the security promises of cloud providers is relinquishing control.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-solution-zero-knowledge-encryption-with-cryptomator">The Solution: Zero-Knowledge Encryption With Cryptomator&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cryptomator takes a fundamentally different approach: &lt;strong>files are encrypted locally on your device before being uploaded to the cloud&lt;/strong>. This means your data remains protected even if the cloud provider is compromised—or, as in the case of OneDrive, simply makes a mistake.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This means:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>No one&lt;/strong> but you can read your files—not Microsoft, not Google, not us.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Access rights&lt;/strong> are secondary, because without the key, all data remains unreadable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even &lt;strong>compromised&lt;/strong> APIs or third-party apps only see encrypted garbage data.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cryptomator Hub&lt;/strong> offers the ideal extension for teams, organizations, and companies:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Centralized management of encrypted vaults&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
IT administrators can preconfigure vaults and share them with specific users—all with end-to-end encryption.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Role-based access control&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Thanks to the role-based system, you can specify exactly who is allowed to create, open, or manage vaults—without central key distribution.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Web of trust for secure collaboration&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Team members verify each other, creating a trustworthy environment—without the need for external certificate authorities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Seamless integration into existing cloud workflows&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Cryptomator Hub can be easily combined with existing cloud storage solutions such as OneDrive, Google Drive, or Dropbox.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Cryptomator Hub enables &lt;strong>highly secure and practical cloud usage within teams&lt;/strong> without the usual compromises in data protection and compliance. This is a future-proof solution, especially for organizations with increased requirements, such as &lt;strong>NGOs, research institutions, or companies in regulated industries&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-you-can-do-now">What You Can Do Now&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Whether you use OneDrive, Dropbox, or another cloud service, this incident shows that &lt;strong>no provider can offer 100% security&lt;/strong> on its own. However, you can drastically reduce your risks by taking a few simple steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Use &lt;strong>client-side encryption&lt;/strong> with tools such as Cryptomator.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do not store particularly sensitive documents unencrypted in the cloud.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Raise awareness among your team members&lt;/strong> or colleagues about cloud access rights.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Check which third-party apps have access to your cloud.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion-safety-begins-with-control">Conclusion: Safety Begins With Control&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The OneDrive security breach is not an isolated incident—it is a symptom of a system that relies on trust rather than real control. But if you &lt;strong>encrypt your files before uploading them&lt;/strong>, you remain protected even in the event of serious security breaches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Cryptomator, you retain full control over your data, your privacy, and your digital security.&lt;/p></description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/10/17/onedrive-security-breach/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/10/17/onedrive-security-breach/</guid><category>cryptomator</category><category>onedrive</category></item><item><title>Back to School – Data Security for Universities</title><description>&lt;p>With the start of the new winter semester, lecture halls are filling up again—as are the &lt;strong>digital platforms of universities&lt;/strong>. Learning management systems, research platforms, cloud storage solutions, and digital administrative processes have long been part of everyday life at universities. But while digitalization opens up new opportunities, it also carries risks: &lt;strong>cyberattacks, data breaches, and inadequately protected cloud data&lt;/strong> jeopardize the integrity and confidentiality of highly sensitive information. In this article, we show why encryption is essential for universities – and how it helps make &lt;strong>research, teaching, and administration more secure&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="text-center">
&lt;img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src="https://staging.cryptomator.org/img/blog/back-to-school.png" alt="Back to School – Data Security for Universities" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="why-universities-are-a-lucrative-target-for-cyberattacks">Why Universities Are a Lucrative Target for Cyberattacks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Universities and colleges process a wide range of sensitive data:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Personal data&lt;/strong> of students, researchers, and employees (e.g., student ID numbers, transcripts, health information).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Research data&lt;/strong>, often related to third-party funding or government-funded projects.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>International collaborations&lt;/strong>, which also require compliance with the regulations of other countries (e.g., FERPA, GDPR).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Login details and access keys&lt;/strong> for learning platforms, email services, and digital resources.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>More and more attacks are targeting universities, for example through ransomware, phishing, or cloud leaks. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/Securitysituation/IT-Security-Situation-in-Germany-2024.html">BSI Situation Report 2024&lt;/a>, educational institutions are among the critical areas with a sharply increased threat level. This makes it all the more important for universities to make their digital structures resilient and encrypted.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="encryption-the-universitys-digital-invisible-ink">Encryption: The University’s Digital Invisible Ink&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Data encryption protects information using mathematical methods—it can only be read with the right key. For universities, this means:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Confidentiality of research results&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Particularly in the case of sensitive basic research or cooperation projects with companies, it is crucial that only authorized persons have access to files. End-to-end encryption protects this data even if a cloud provider is compromised.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Data protection for students and teachers&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
The EU GDPR requires universities to comprehensively protect personal data. Encryption enables data processing that complies with data protection regulations—even when using the cloud, working from home, or using BYOD models.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Protection against ransomware and data loss&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Encrypted backups and protected storage systems can greatly limit the impact of ransomware attacks. Attackers have no access to unencrypted original data, and recovery can take place without payment.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>The digitization of higher education is unstoppable—but it is not defenseless. Those who encrypt today will protect the autonomy of research and teaching tomorrow. Universities that rely on simple, secure, and privacy-compliant encryption solutions build trust among students, employees, and partner institutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now is the ideal time to evaluate existing systems, raise awareness, and integrate encryption solutions for the long term.&lt;/p></description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/10/10/back-to-school/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/10/10/back-to-school/</guid><category>cryptomator</category><category>university</category></item><item><title>Cryptomator Desktop 1.18.0 Beta – Try it now!</title><description>&lt;figure class="text-center">
&lt;img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src="https://staging.cryptomator.org/img/blog/desktop-1.18.0-beta.png" alt="Cryptomator Desktop 1.18.0 Beta" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The next release of Cryptomator Desktop is right around the corner – and before we publish the final version, we&amp;rsquo;d like to invite you to test the beta of version 1.18.0. Along with useful new features and important bug fixes, this release also comes with a special call to our community.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-features--fixes">New Features &amp;amp; Fixes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With Cryptomator Desktop 1.18.0, we’re once again bringing improvements and bug fixes across all platforms:&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="new-feature">New Feature&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Remember Last Vault Location&lt;br>
When creating a new vault, Cryptomator will now automatically suggest the last chosen storage location. This makes setup more convenient, especially if you manage multiple vaults in similar folder structures.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="fixes">Fixes&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Linux/KDE: QuickAccess Entries&lt;br>
On KDE, each unlock process created a new QuickAccess entry in the Dolphin file manager, even if one already existed (e.g., after an unexpected app crash). This is now fixed – existing entries are reused, and no manual cleanup is needed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prevention of Huge Log Files&lt;br>
On Windows, log files could in rare cases grow extremely large, causing system issues. The existing size limit of log files was bypassed in those cases. This has been fixed, so the app can safely run in the background without issues.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>macOS: Stability When Saving Vault Passwords&lt;br>
Some users experienced app crashes when trying to save a vault password. This bug has now been fixed, so password saving on macOS works reliably.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>macOS: macFUSE Detection on macOS 26&lt;br>
In the upcoming macOS version 26, macFUSE was sometimes not detected, leading to problems when mounting vaults. This issue is fixed to ensure Cryptomator works smoothly on the latest macOS releases.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div class="text-center">
&lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.18.0-beta1/">&lt;i class="fa-solid fa-download">&lt;/i> Download the Beta 1.18.0 here&lt;/a>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="we-need-your-support">We Need Your Support!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In addition to these updates, there’s something special this time:&lt;br>
Our Windows installer is now signed with a new certificate. Since this certificate is not yet widely recognized in Microsoft’s trust network, Windows may display a security prompt when installing the beta version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The more people install the beta, the faster the certificate will gain trust – and the security dialog will disappear. Don’t worry: the installer is still safe and signed by us. Windows just needs to “learn” that the new certificate is trustworthy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="final-words">Final Words&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With version 1.18.0, we’re making Cryptomator more convenient, stable, and future-proof. The beta is an important step – not only to test the new features and fixes, but also to establish our new certificate in the Windows ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We’re grateful for every bit of support from the community:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Install the beta and try out the updates.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Share your feedback if you notice anything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Help us make the final release as stable and user-friendly as possible.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Your feedback makes Cryptomator stronger – and ensures we can all keep our data securely encrypted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you for your support – we can’t wait for the final release of 1.18.0! 🎉&lt;/p></description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/09/26/desktop-beta-1.18.0/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/09/26/desktop-beta-1.18.0/</guid><category>cryptomator</category><category>desktop</category><category>beta</category></item><item><title>Cryptomator Autumn Sale: Protect Your Data – and Your Wallet!</title><description>&lt;figure class="text-center">

In this article, we outline how this affects Cryptomator and what our plan is to become fully quantum-secure.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cryptographic-breakdown">Cryptographic Breakdown&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the ciphers involved in Cryptomator:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="text-center">
&lt;img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src="https://staging.cryptomator.org/img/blog/traditional-cipher-breakdown.svg" alt="Plot showing the growth of 2^n compared to n^2" />
&lt;figcaption>Cryptographic Breakdown of Cryptomator &amp; Cryptomator Hub&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>As you can see, we mostly rely on AES- and EC-based algorithms. These are traditional algorithms whose security assumptions apply in a world of classical (non-quantum) computers. The general idea is that computations are efficient if you know the right key but practically impossible without. When I say &amp;ldquo;practically impossible&amp;rdquo; I mean on traditional computers, as the computations are just &amp;ldquo;too complex&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-few-words-about-complexity">A Few Words About Complexity&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>While we aim to avoid complexity when it comes to usability or code legibility, there is a specific kind of complexity that we strive for. Let me explain:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we want to express how many steps a certain computation requires, we categorize algorithms into classes of computational complexity. To illustrate this concept, here are some dog-related examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Complexity Class&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Example&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Big O&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Constant Time&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Blowing the dog whistle always takes the same time, regardless of how many dogs are listening.&lt;/td>
&lt;td>O(1)&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Logarithmic Time&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Finding the phone number of a pet clinic is easy with a telephone book, as it&amp;rsquo;s sorted alphabetically and allows you to quickly narrow down the pages.&lt;/td>
&lt;td>O(log n)&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Linear Time&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Petting every dog. If every dog gets the same attention, it takes exactly n times longer, if you have n dogs.&lt;/td>
&lt;td>O(n)&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Polynomial Time&lt;/td>
&lt;td>If every dog at a party wants to sniff and greet every other dog. Dog 1 sniffs dog 2, 3, 4, &amp;hellip; Dog 2 sniffs dog 3, 4, &amp;hellip; and so on.&lt;/td>
&lt;td>O(nᵏ)&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Exponential Time&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Every dog has 4 puppies. That makes 16 dogs after two generations, 64 after three generations and 256 after four generations.&lt;/td>
&lt;td>O(kⁿ)&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>To ensure that breaking a cipher requires an insane amount of time and energy, cryptographic algorithms rely on hard-to-compute problems—i.e., we&amp;rsquo;re operating on the more complex side of the spectrum.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most illustrative example for this is the factorization problem: Determine the prime factors of 8633. The result is easy to verify through a simple multiplication (89 × 97), but finding the factors from the product is hard; &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_number_field_sieve">harder than polynomial but subexponential&lt;/a>. This is exactly what the RSA crypto scheme is based on (except with some &lt;em>very&lt;/em> large numbers), where the public key includes the product of two secret primes that are required to compute the private key.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-quantum-computers-weaken-ciphers">How Quantum Computers Weaken Ciphers&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="asymmetric-cryptography">Asymmetric Cryptography&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Quantum computers are not inherently faster, but they allow for a different set of algorithms to run. So, while a problem may be hard-to-compute for traditional algorithms, it could be far less complex when solved with quantum algorithms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the most infamous examples is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor&amp;rsquo;s algorithm&lt;/a>, which solves the factorization problem in polynomial time. While polynomial time is just one row above exponential time in the table above, it makes all the difference. The following graph illustrates the effect of an increasing problem size on the two complexity classes:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="text-center">
&lt;img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src="https://staging.cryptomator.org/img/blog/pqc-complexity-classes.svg" alt="Plot showing the growth of 2^n compared to n^2" />
&lt;figcaption>Growth curves of polynomial and exponential functions&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>If a quantum computer can be built that is capable of running Shor&amp;rsquo;s algorithm on large numbers, it would break most of today&amp;rsquo;s public-key cryptography—including ECDH.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="symmetric-cryptography">Symmetric Cryptography&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Imagine a number lock with four digits. To guess the correct combination, a traditional computer would have to check every possibility, starting with 0000 and ending with 9999. On average, it would take 5,000 guesses. Now, what if I told you that a quantum computer could do it in just 100 guesses? Sounds like magic? That is exactly what Grover&amp;rsquo;s algorithm can achieve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More generally, when a traditional algorithm takes \(n/2\) steps on average, a quantum computer only needs \(\sqrt n\) attempts—a speed-up that the BBBV theorem proves to be the best possible solution. If you want to understand how this works, there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQWpF2Gb-gU">a great video by 3Blue1Brown about Grover&amp;rsquo;s Algorithm&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This &amp;ldquo;magic&amp;rdquo; applies to any problem where it&amp;rsquo;s efficient to check if a guessed solution is correct. That&amp;rsquo;s obviously a problem if you don&amp;rsquo;t want an attacker to guess your secret key. Fortunately, the defense is simple: increase \(n\) to a size where even \(\sqrt n\) becomes large enough to make Grover&amp;rsquo;s algorithm impractical.&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="admonition-content">
&lt;p>Ever wondered why we use AES-256 instead of AES-128?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;256&amp;rdquo; refers to the number of key bits, resulting in \(2^{256}\) possible keys. Guessing the correct key would therefore take \(2^{256} / 2 = 2^{255}\) attempts on a traditional computer and \(\sqrt{2^{256}} = 2^{128}\) attempts using Grover&amp;rsquo;s algorithm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Making \(2^{128}\) guesses is simply unfeasible. So, while AES-128 suffices on traditional computers, the post-quantum world demands for AES-256.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>So, while a sufficiently large key space is enough for AES, our asymmetric ciphers need to be replaced to withstand attacks from quantum computers. In 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) launched a competition to identify quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Electing algorithms through a competition has already proven successful in the past, as with AES and SHA-3. This approach attracts significant attention from experts, who do their best to uncover weaknesses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2022, after several rounds of eliminating dozens of candidates, NIST &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/07/nist-announces-first-four-quantum-resistant-cryptographic-algorithms">announced the winners&lt;/a>. Kyber and Dilithium—named after crystals from Star Wars and Star Trek, respectively—became the first standardized post-quantum algorithms for encryption and digital signatures. They were officially named ML-KEM and ML-DSA.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Again, here is a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K026C5YaB3A">great video explaining the underlying math of ML-based cryptography&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;p>Great! So let&amp;rsquo;s integrate ML-KEM and ML-DSA into Cryptomator Hub:&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;But wait, there is still ECDH in it!?&amp;rdquo; I hear you say. And you&amp;rsquo;re right. Despite the new ciphers being very promising, we have to face the fact that they simply haven&amp;rsquo;t been around for long. We just don&amp;rsquo;t know yet what kinds of attacks might be discovered in the future—or whether these algorithms will truly stand the test of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, to be extra cautious, we combine a traditional cipher and a post-quantum one. Think of it like a door with two locks: if one is broken, the other still protects what&amp;rsquo;s inside. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple design that ensures the system is no weaker than its individual components. This post-quantum/traditional (PQ/T) hybrid is called &lt;em>X-Wing&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

&lt;figcaption>Cryptomator will use X-Wing&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>X-Wing is still a work in progress, but I reached out to the RFC authors—Deirdre Connolly, Peter Schwabe, and Bas Westerbaan—to ask when we can expect the final specification to be published. Just ten minutes later, Bas replied:&lt;/p>

&lt;span>If PQ/T hybrids are preferable, what about a hybrid signature scheme?&lt;/span>

&lt;div class="admonition-content">
&lt;p>Yes, there are also &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-prabel-jose-pq-composite-sigs/02/">efforts to standardize a combination of ML-DSA and ECDSA&lt;/a>. Other than X-Wing, this is in an earlier phase, though. We are closely following developments in this area and will probably make use of this scheme once it is ready.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="standardizing-cryptography">Standardizing Cryptography&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="benefits-of-standardization">Benefits of Standardization&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In every industry, standardization plays a key role. It ensures compatibility, promotes interoperability, and reduces costs by enabling different systems and organizations to work together using common protocols and specifications—maintaining consistency and reliability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the security sector, standardization is even more critical. Algorithms, protocols, and data formats must not only function reliably across heterogeneous systems—they must also withstand rigorous scrutiny. The more experts peer review a standard, the better. As with the NIST competitions mentioned earlier, such scrutiny can uncover weaknesses &lt;em>before&lt;/em> a cipher is deployed in production. By adhering to established, transparent standards, both developers and users benefit from stronger, more trustworthy protection—especially as the threat landscape evolves with technologies like quantum computing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ignoring such standards—sometimes in the name of speed or convenience—sets you on a path that may be paved with hidden flaws. Even the smallest change can introduce serious vulnerabilities that, without thorough peer reviews, are likely to be discovered first by someone smarter and less well-intentioned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At Cryptomator, we&amp;rsquo;ve always stood against &amp;ldquo;security through obscurity&amp;rdquo; (which is also &lt;a href="https://staging.cryptomator.org/guides/open-source/">why open source matters&lt;/a>). Needless to say, we&amp;rsquo;ve never used home-cooked ciphers—that would pose a serious risk. And the more widely used an algorithm or protocol is, the easier it becomes to understand, verify, and audit the system as a whole.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="a-strong-foundation">A Strong Foundation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Many standards are built upon others. Without ML-KEM, there would be no X-Wing. Now that X-Wing is around the corner, what can we do with it? Use it in yet another standard: &lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9180.html">HPKE&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>HPKE stands for Hybrid Public Key Encryption—and to be precise, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t depend on X-Wing at all. Instead, it defines how to combine three different cryptographic ingredients—KEM, KDF, and AEAD—in a specific way that ensures well-defined security properties. And X-Wing can serve as one of these ingredients (the KEM).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another standard that we&amp;rsquo;ve come to love is JWE, a data format for exchanging encrypted payloads. And guess what—there are people working on &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-reddy-cose-jose-pqc-hybrid-hpke-07">standardizing the use of X-Wing-based HPKE in JWE&lt;/a>. That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what we want to adopt in Cryptomator Hub, replacing the current ECDH-based JWEs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond the aforementioned benefits of peer reviews, adopting standardized formats over proprietary ones provides several additional advantages:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Common APIs make it easy to swap out implementations—for example, HPKE usage remains the same regardless of the underlying algorithms.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wide availability of well-established libraries. For instance, there are dozens of JWE/JWT libraries.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Official test vectors allows us to write tests that fail the build early if something goes wrong.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Faster vulnerabilities awareness: If a flaw is discovered in a widely used standard, it will likely be reported quickly—whereas a single proprietary implementation may go unnoticed for much longer.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Both JWE and HPKE support interchangeable internal algorithms while maintaining a consistent external interface. This allows us to retain the overall structure and quickly replace internal components if vulnerabilities arise.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The moral is the need for cryptographic agility. It’s not enough to implement a single standard; it’s vital that our systems be able to easily swap in new algorithms when required.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="standardizing-the-vault-format">Standardizing the Vault Format&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>So, if all the ciphers used in Cryptomator products—as well as the exchange of secrets in Cryptomator Hub—are based on standards, what about the vault format?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While we use well-established cryptography, the file formats themselves are our own. But we want to change that. Some time ago, we joined forces with developers of Cyberduck, gocryptfs, and rclone to derive a common format for encrypted directories—ensuring interoperability across our tools. Although the format is still a work in progress, we hope to share more details with you in a couple of months. In the meantime, you&amp;rsquo;re of course invited to review the format and contribute ideas for improvement on &lt;a href="https://github.com/encryption-alliance/unified-vault-format">GitHub&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One key benefit of this &lt;em>Unified Vault Format&lt;/em> is that it enables key rotation—which itself brings two major advantages:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Access revocation&lt;/strong>: After rotating keys, former vault members can no longer decrypt files added after their access got revoked. What is trivial with access control lists requires special care when we want to enforce this cryptographically.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Cipher agility&lt;/strong>: To some extent, it enables cipher upgrades. For example, if a vulnerability is found in one algorithm, we can flip a switch and transition to a new JWE algorithm—instantly protecting all newly added files.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="in-short-where-do-we-stand">In Short: Where Do We Stand?&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="cryptomator">Cryptomator&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As explained above, Cryptomator is already quantum-secure. Since it uses only symmetric ciphers with sufficiently large key spaces, quantum computers currently pose no known threat.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="cryptomator-hub">Cryptomator Hub&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Cryptomator Hub, on the other hand, will need to migrate to different algorithms. These are the steps we want to take:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;em>(In progress)&lt;/em> Implement X-Wing: As a 100% open-source company, we have always contributed to other libraries and projects. As mentioned before, we&amp;rsquo;re in contact with the authors of the &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-connolly-cfrg-xwing-kem/">X-Wing RFC&lt;/a> and also with the JDK security team in order to add &lt;a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/pull/26032">X-Wing support in the OpenJDK&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>(In progress)&lt;/em> Implement HPKE in JWE libraries: We have been contributing to one of the most widely used &lt;a href="https://connect2id.com/products/nimbus-jose-jwt">JOSE libraries for Java&lt;/a> from the very beginning of Cryptomator. Unsurprisingly, it is therefore in our interest to add HPKE support (and then X-Wing based HPHKE) as defined in &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-reddy-cose-jose-pqc-hybrid-hpke-07">JOSE HPKE RFC&lt;/a>. The RFC authors (one of whom we know personally) are already eager to hear our feedback.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Migrate the JWEs used in Cryptomator Hub from traditional to PQ/T hybrid cryptography. We want to start this as soon as the standards are finalized and the aforementioned algorithm implementations can be published in upstream libraries.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Introduce a new vault format that will improve the cipher agility and has further benefits for Cryptomator Hub users.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>As you can see this is a collaborative effort. All to build a resilient foundation for the years ahead.&lt;/p></description><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/07/24/post-quantum-roadmap/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/07/24/post-quantum-roadmap/</guid><category>cryptomator</category><category>encryption</category></item><item><title>Cryptomator 1.17.0: Windows, say "Hello"!</title><description>&lt;p>With the new update to version &lt;strong>1.17.0&lt;/strong>, Cryptomator becomes even better — more stable, more compatible, and more user-friendly. In this blog post, we’ll take a look at the most exciting new features and explain why this upgrade is worth it.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="whats-new">What’s New?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Windows Hello Integration&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Starting now, you can unlock your vaults on Windows using &lt;strong>Windows Hello&lt;/strong> — whether via facial recognition, fingerprint, or PIN. Added security meets maximum convenience. Once again, big thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/purejava">Ralph (purejava on GitHub)&lt;/a> for contributing to this feature!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Double-Click to Unlock Vaults&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can now unlock your vaults by simply &lt;strong>double-clicking the&lt;/strong> &lt;code>vault.cryptomator&lt;/code> &lt;strong>file&lt;/strong> — no need to open the app interface first. This makes accessing frequently used vaults even easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Updated Graphical Framework: JavaFX 24&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Under the hood, Cryptomator&amp;rsquo;s graphical foundation has been updated to &lt;strong>JavaFX 24&lt;/strong>. This not only brings greater stability but also improves compatibility with modern systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-fixed">What’s Fixed?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>WinFsp Update: Blue Screen on Windows Resolved&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the most important updates concerns the &lt;strong>WinFsp driver&lt;/strong>, which Cryptomator uses to mount vaults. The update to the latest version fixes a critical bug that, in combination with certain Trend Micro security products, could cause a blue screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Legacy Vaults Can Be Imported Again&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A pesky bug has been squashed: &lt;strong>Importing legacy vaults now works smoothly again&lt;/strong>. So if you have older backups, you can now restore them without any issues in this version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find all the other changes in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.17.0">changelog on GitHub&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="and-what-about-windows-arm">And what about Windows ARM?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, the native ARM app for Windows must be postponed due to a bug in the JDK framework. We are working on a fix but cannot announce a release date yet.&lt;/p>

In an age of increasing cyberattacks and near-daily data leaks, it&amp;rsquo;s more important than ever to raise awareness for better password hygiene.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-reality-123456-is-still-a-classic">The Reality: “123456” is Still a Classic&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>According to the &lt;a href="https://nordpass.com/most-common-passwords-list">NordPass 2024 password report&lt;/a>, “123456” is once again the most commonly used password worldwide. In Germany, “admin” tops the list. Millions of people still rely on passwords that are easy to guess – with serious consequences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cybercriminals use automated tools to crack weak passwords in seconds. When a data breach occurs, these passwords are often tested across multiple platforms – a huge problem if you&amp;rsquo;ve reused them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="i-have-nothing-to-hide--really">“I have nothing to hide” – Really?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This belief is common, but dangerously misleading. Even if your data seems “unimportant” at first glance, attackers can abuse it to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Steal your identity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Send emails in your name&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Access other linked accounts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Extort or scam you or your contacts&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not just about private photos or chats – it’s about your entire digital identity and your trust in online services.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="three-everyday-examples-that-show-how-quickly-it-can-happen">Three Everyday Examples That Show How Quickly It Can Happen&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The compromised streaming account&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Your streaming service password was leaked. Attackers use it to send phishing emails or test access to other services.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The reused password&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
You use the same password for your personal email and your work account. If one gets hacked, both are compromised.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Social engineering with weak passwords&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
An attacker guesses your password using public info (e.g., birthdate + pet’s name) and gains access to your cloud storage.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="when-it-gets-expensive-three-real-world-scenarios">When It Gets Expensive: Three Real-World Scenarios&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Hacked email leads to identity theft&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
An attacker gains access to your email via a weak password.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Resets your other account passwords&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Uses your email for scams or phishing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Orders goods in your name&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Outcome:&lt;/strong> Financial loss, damage to reputation, tedious recovery process&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Online banking access through password recycling&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
A leaked password from a forum is reused for online banking. A bot tests major banking sites.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Outcome:&lt;/strong> Drained account, legal issues, possible criminal report&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Ransomware in a company via weak admin password&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
A VPN login is compromised due to a weak password. Attackers install ransomware.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Outcome:&lt;/strong> Business shutdown, ransom demand, data loss, GDPR breach&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="password-check-how-safe-are-you">Password Check: How Safe Are You?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Run a quick self-check:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;input disabled="" type="checkbox"> I use a unique password for each account&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;input disabled="" type="checkbox"> My passwords are at least 12 characters long and include numbers &amp;amp; symbols&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;input disabled="" type="checkbox"> I use a password manager&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;input disabled="" type="checkbox"> I have activated two-factor authentication (2FA)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;input disabled="" type="checkbox"> I reviewed or changed my passwords in the last 12 months&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Tip:&lt;/strong> Check if your data has been exposed in a breach: &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com">haveibeenpwned.com&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tools-instead-of-headaches-use-a-password-manager">Tools Instead of Headaches: Use a Password Manager&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Nobody can remember dozens of complex passwords – and they don’t have to. &lt;strong>Password managers&lt;/strong> like Bitwarden, 1Password or KeePass help you generate, store and autofill strong passwords.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The biggest advantage: You only need to remember one master password – the app takes care of the rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="extra-protection-with-two-factor-authentication">Extra Protection With Two-Factor Authentication&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Even the strongest password could end up in a data leak. That’s why you should &lt;strong>always enable two-factor authentication (2FA)&lt;/strong> wherever possible. In addition to your password, you’ll enter a code sent via app or SMS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This makes it much harder for attackers to access your accounts – even if they have your password.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion-password-security-isnt-a-nice-to-have">Conclusion: Password Security Isn’t a “Nice-to-Have”&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The effort required for strong passwords is small – but the benefits are huge. By changing a few habits, you protect yourself from real threats and ensure long-term digital safety.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Now is the best time to update weak passwords, start using a password manager, and enable 2FA.&lt;/strong> &lt;em>Your digital future will thank you.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/05/01/world-password-day/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/05/01/world-password-day/</guid><category>event</category></item><item><title>Cryptomator 1.16.0 is here - with practical new features!</title><description>&lt;p>The latest version of our desktop app has been released! &lt;strong>Cryptomator 1.16.0&lt;/strong> introduces several exciting new features that make working with encrypted files even more convenient. This update focuses on new functions that provide greater transparency and control over your vaults – and even &lt;strong>biometric unlocking&lt;/strong> on Mac!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="whats-new">What&amp;rsquo;s New?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>EventView: Overview of Important Vault Events&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Want to know if any conflicts occurred when unlocking a vault or if corrupted files were detected? With the new &lt;strong>EventView&lt;/strong>, you now get a clear overview of relevant events within an unlocked vault – such as conflict resolutions or notifications about corrupted files. This way, you always stay informed about what&amp;rsquo;s happening inside your vault.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="text-center">
&lt;img class="inline-block rounded-sm max-h-[430px]" src="https://staging.cryptomator.org/img/blog/desktop-1.16.0-eventview.png" alt="EventView in Cryptomator 1.16.0" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Decrypt File Names&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
With the new &lt;strong>Decrypt File Name&lt;/strong> feature, you can select encrypted files within a vault and retrieve their original, unencrypted filenames – without needing to open the file itself. A handy tool for anyone needing a quick overview!&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="text-center">

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Touch ID Support for macOS&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Starting now, you can unlock your vaults on &lt;strong>Mac&lt;/strong> easily with &lt;strong>Touch ID&lt;/strong>! This makes using Cryptomator not only faster but also more convenient and secure – especially on devices with biometric authentication. Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/purejava">Ralph (purejava on GitHub)&lt;/a> for the great support!&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;h3 id="bugfixes">Bugfixes&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Of course, we also &lt;strong>fixed several bugs&lt;/strong> – here’s a quick overview:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The &lt;strong>main window&lt;/strong> is now displayed correctly again on Windows.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;strong>tray icon&lt;/strong> now reliably adapts to the OS theme on Linux. Thanks again to Ralph for the help!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The app now properly quits when the main window is closed (if no tray is active).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Supporter certificates&lt;/strong> can now be properly removed again.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In case of &lt;strong>filename conflicts&lt;/strong>, the original suffixes provided by your cloud service are now largely preserved – instead of being replaced by a simple numbering system.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="full-changelog-on-github">Full Changelog on GitHub&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In addition to the highlights mentioned above, there are also &lt;strong>several smaller improvements and updates&lt;/strong> – such as enhancements to vault settings, better symbolic icon support on Linux, and translation updates. You can find the complete list of changes as always in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.16.0">&lt;strong>Changelog&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> on GitHub.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Thanks to all contributors&lt;/strong> from the community – and &lt;strong>enjoy the new update&lt;/strong>!&lt;/p></description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/04/29/desktop-1.16.0/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/04/29/desktop-1.16.0/</guid><category>cryptomator</category><category>desktop</category></item><item><title>Cryptomator Hub 1.4.0: More Trust, More Control, More Transparency</title><description>&lt;p>With the release of version 1.4.0, &lt;strong>Cryptomator Hub&lt;/strong> receives a major feature upgrade that offers more control and transparency — while also improving the overall user experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the heart of this release are a new &lt;strong>Web of Trust&lt;/strong>, finer-grained &lt;strong>permission management&lt;/strong>, extended &lt;strong>audit logging&lt;/strong>, and deeper &lt;strong>insights into user profiles&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s take a closer look at what’s new!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="web-of-trust-mutual-verification-for-better-security">Web of Trust: Mutual Verification for Better Security&lt;/h2>
&lt;figure class="text-center">
&lt;img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src="https://staging.cryptomator.org/img/blog/hub-1.4.0-wot.png" alt="Hub 1.4.0 WoT" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>One of the highlights of this release is the new &lt;strong>Web of Trust (WoT)&lt;/strong>. Users can now mutually verify each other&amp;rsquo;s identities by signing public keys. This creates a network of trust that protects against the injection of manipulated or forged public keys.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This feature directly addresses so-called &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;key injection&amp;rdquo; risks&lt;/strong> and strengthens the protection of sensitive data across organizations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The verification process is based on a simple but effective principle: &lt;strong>Only when a person’s public key is confirmed by trusted peers is their identity considered verified.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Admins can configure how many verifications are required.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-create-vaults-role-granular-permissions-for-vault-creation">New Create-Vaults Role: Granular Permissions for Vault Creation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With the introduction of the new &lt;code>create-vaults&lt;/code> role, admins now have full control over who is allowed to create new vaults within the organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Previously, this permission was available to all users by default — now, admins can specify whether only certain teams, individuals, or everyone should have access to this feature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Especially in large organizations, this is a key improvement for maintaining order and managing infrastructure growth in a more controlled way.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="audit-log-even-more-precise-activity-tracking">Audit Log: Even More Precise Activity Tracking&lt;/h2>
&lt;figure class="text-center">
&lt;img class="inline-block rounded-sm max-h-[553px]" src="https://staging.cryptomator.org/img/blog/hub-1.4.0-auditlog.png" alt="Hub 1.4.0 Audit Log" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Monitoring security-relevant actions is a key responsibility in IT operations. With version 1.4.0, the &lt;strong>audit log&lt;/strong> becomes even more powerful:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Filter by event type:&lt;/strong> You can now filter audit log entries by type — such as key changes, access attempts, or account activity — to quickly isolate relevant data during incidents.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>New events:&lt;/strong> Several new &lt;a href="https://docs.cryptomator.org/hub/admin/#event-types">event types&lt;/a> were added to better capture security-critical actions.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Register Device&lt;/strong> – A user registered a new device, e.g., Cryptomator app or browser session.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Remove Device&lt;/strong> – A user removed a device.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Signed Identity&lt;/strong> – A user signed another user’s identity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Account Key Changed&lt;/strong> – A user regenerated their account key, which also affects user keys.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Reset User Account&lt;/strong> – A user reset their account.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>User Keys Change&lt;/strong> – A user changed their keys, e.g., during initial setup or account key updates.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Claim Vault Ownership&lt;/strong> – A user claimed ownership of a vault that was created with a Hub version prior to 1.3.0 using the Vault Admin Password.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Retrieve Vault Key event enhanced:&lt;/strong> This audit event now includes the &lt;strong>IP address and device ID&lt;/strong> — making it easier to trace who unlocked a vault and from which device.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="more-transparency-in-user-profile">More Transparency in User Profile&lt;/h2>
&lt;figure class="text-center">
&lt;img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src="https://staging.cryptomator.org/img/blog/hub-1.4.0-profile.png" alt="Hub 1.4.0 Profile View" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The user interface has also been updated to offer more transparency about devices and access patterns:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Legacy devices:&lt;/strong> Users can now see if they’re still using devices linked to vaults created with older versions of the Hub. This helps with migrations to the current user-key-based encryption introduced in version 1.3.0.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Last IP and vault access timestamp:&lt;/strong> The device overview now shows the &lt;strong>last known IP address&lt;/strong> and the &lt;strong>most recent vault access timestamp&lt;/strong> for each device — ideal for identifying suspicious activity.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="new-languages-and-improved-usability">New Languages and Improved Usability&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>More language support:&lt;/strong> Cryptomator Hub is now available in &lt;strong>Dutch, French, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Turkish&lt;/strong> — making it even more accessible for international teams.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Language preference is preserved:&lt;/strong> Your selected language setting is now saved in your user profile and no longer resets after logout.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="provenance-attestation-for-container-images">Provenance Attestation for Container Images&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A frequently overlooked but critical area of security is the &lt;strong>authenticity of software containers&lt;/strong>. Starting with version 1.4.0, we now publish &lt;strong>provenance attestations&lt;/strong> for our container images.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These attestations document the origin and integrity of our images and provide additional assurance for automated deployments and CI/CD pipelines.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="full-changelog">Full Changelog&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>All technical details, fixes, and improvements can be found in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/hub/releases/tag/1.4.0">release notes&lt;/a> and the new &lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/hub/blob/1.4.0/CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG&lt;/a> file.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cryptomator Hub 1.4.0&lt;/strong> is a release that builds trust — through greater visibility, more refined controls, and solid technical foundations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whether it’s security management, role-based permissions, or user-facing transparency: This update lays the groundwork for even more robust data infrastructures in organizations that take encryption seriously.&lt;/p></description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/04/15/hub-1.4.0/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/04/15/hub-1.4.0/</guid><category>cryptomator</category><category>hub</category></item></channel></rss>
