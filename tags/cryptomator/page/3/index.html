Along with useful new features and important bug fixes, this release also comes with a special call to our community.</p><h2 id=new-features--fixes>New Features & Fixes</h2><p>With Cryptomator Desktop 1.18.0, we’re once again bringing improvements and bug fixes across all platforms:</p><h4 id=new-feature>New Feature</h4><ul><li>Remember Last Vault Location<br>When creating a new vault, Cryptomator will now automatically suggest the last chosen storage location. This makes setup more convenient, especially if you manage multiple vaults in similar folder structures.</li></ul><h4 id=fixes>Fixes</h4><ul><li>Linux/KDE: QuickAccess Entries<br>On KDE, each unlock process created a new QuickAccess entry in the Dolphin file manager, even if one already existed (e.g., after an unexpected app crash). This is now fixed – existing entries are reused, and no manual cleanup is needed.</li><li>Prevention of Huge Log Files<br>On Windows, log files could in rare cases grow extremely large, causing system issues. The existing size limit of log files was bypassed in those cases. This has been fixed, so the app can safely run in the background without issues.</li><li>macOS: Stability When Saving Vault Passwords<br>Some users experienced app crashes when trying to save a vault password. This bug has now been fixed, so password saving on macOS works reliably.</li><li>macOS: macFUSE Detection on macOS 26<br>In the upcoming macOS version 26, macFUSE was sometimes not detected, leading to problems when mounting vaults. This issue is fixed to ensure Cryptomator works smoothly on the latest macOS releases.</li></ul><div class=text-center><a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.18.0-beta1/><i class="fa-solid fa-download"></i> Download the Beta 1.18.0 here</a></div><h2 id=we-need-your-support>We Need Your Support!</h2><p>In addition to these updates, there’s something special this time:<br>Our Windows installer is now signed with a new certificate.

In this article, we outline how this affects Cryptomator and what our plan is to become fully quantum-secure.</p><h2 id=cryptographic-breakdown>Cryptographic Breakdown</h2><p>First, let&rsquo;s take a look at the ciphers involved in Cryptomator:</p><figure class=text-center><img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src=/img/blog/traditional-cipher-breakdown.svg alt="Plot showing the growth of 2^n compared to n^2"><figcaption>Cryptographic Breakdown of Cryptomator & Cryptomator Hub</figcaption></figure><p>As you can see, we mostly rely on AES- and EC-based algorithms. These are traditional algorithms whose security assumptions apply in a world of classical (non-quantum) computers. The general idea is that computations are efficient if you know the right key but practically impossible without. When I say &ldquo;practically impossible&rdquo; I mean on traditional computers, as the computations are just &ldquo;too complex&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=a-few-words-about-complexity>A Few Words About Complexity</h2><p>While we aim to avoid complexity when it comes to usability or code legibility, there is a specific kind of complexity that we strive for. Let me explain:</p><p>When we want to express how many steps a certain computation requires, we categorize algorithms into classes of computational complexity. To illustrate this concept, here are some dog-related examples:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Complexity Class</th><th>Example</th><th>Big O</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Constant Time</td><td>Blowing the dog whistle always takes the same time, regardless of how many dogs are listening.</td><td>O(1)</td></tr><tr><td>Logarithmic Time</td><td>Finding the phone number of a pet clinic is easy with a telephone book, as it&rsquo;s sorted alphabetically and allows you to quickly narrow down the pages.</td><td>O(log n)</td></tr><tr><td>Linear Time</td><td>Petting every dog. If every dog gets the same attention, it takes exactly n times longer, if you have n dogs.</td><td>O(n)</td></tr><tr><td>Polynomial Time</td><td>If every dog at a party wants to sniff and greet every other dog. Dog 1 sniffs dog 2, 3, 4, &mldr; Dog 2 sniffs dog 3, 4, &mldr; and so on.</td><td>O(nᵏ)</td></tr><tr><td>Exponential Time</td><td>Every dog has 4 puppies. That makes 16 dogs after two generations, 64 after three generations and 256 after four generations.</td><td>O(kⁿ)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>To ensure that breaking a cipher requires an insane amount of time and energy, cryptographic algorithms rely on hard-to-compute problems—i.e., we&rsquo;re operating on the more complex side of the spectrum.</p><p>The most illustrative example for this is the factorization problem: Determine the prime factors of 8633. The result is easy to verify through a simple multiplication (89 × 97), but finding the factors from the product is hard; <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_number_field_sieve>harder than polynomial but subexponential</a>. This is exactly what the RSA crypto scheme is based on (except with some <em>very</em> large numbers), where the public key includes the product of two secret primes that are required to compute the private key.</p><h2 id=how-quantum-computers-weaken-ciphers>How Quantum Computers Weaken Ciphers</h2><h3 id=asymmetric-cryptography>Asymmetric Cryptography</h3><p>Quantum computers are not inherently faster, but they allow for a different set of algorithms to run. So, while a problem may be hard-to-compute for traditional algorithms, it could be far less complex when solved with quantum algorithms.</p><p>One of the most infamous examples is <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm>Shor&rsquo;s algorithm</a>, which solves the factorization problem in polynomial time. While polynomial time is just one row above exponential time in the table above, it makes all the difference. The following graph illustrates the effect of an increasing problem size on the two complexity classes:</p><figure class=text-center><img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src=/img/blog/pqc-complexity-classes.svg alt="Plot showing the growth of 2^n compared to n^2"><figcaption>Growth curves of polynomial and exponential functions</figcaption></figure><p>If a quantum computer can be built that is capable of running Shor&rsquo;s algorithm on large numbers, it would break most of today&rsquo;s public-key cryptography—including ECDH.</p><h3 id=symmetric-cryptography>Symmetric Cryptography</h3><p>Imagine a number lock with four digits. To guess the correct combination, a traditional computer would have to check every possibility, starting with 0000 and ending with 9999. On average, it would take 5,000 guesses. Now, what if I told you that a quantum computer could do it in just 100 guesses? Sounds like magic? That is exactly what Grover&rsquo;s algorithm can achieve.</p><p>More generally, when a traditional algorithm takes \(n/2\) steps on average, a quantum computer only needs \(\sqrt n\) attempts—a speed-up that the BBBV theorem proves to be the best possible solution. If you want to understand how this works, there&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQWpF2Gb-gU">a great video by 3Blue1Brown about Grover&rsquo;s Algorithm</a>.</p><p>This &ldquo;magic&rdquo; applies to any problem where it&rsquo;s efficient to check if a guessed solution is correct. That&rsquo;s obviously a problem if you don&rsquo;t want an attacker to guess your secret key. Fortunately, the defense is simple: increase \(n\) to a size where even \(\sqrt n\) becomes large enough to make Grover&rsquo;s algorithm impractical.</p><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/vendors/admonitions.css><div class="admonition question"><div class=admonition-header><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M256 512A256 256 0 10256 0a256 256 0 100 512zM169.8 165.3c7.9-22.3 29.1-37.3 52.8-37.3h58.3c34.9.0 63.1 28.3 63.1 63.1.0 22.6-12.1 43.5-31.7 54.8L280 264.4c-.2 13-10.9 23.6-24 23.6-13.3.0-24-10.7-24-24v-13.5c0-8.6 4.6-16.5 12.1-20.8l44.3-25.4c4.7-2.7 7.6-7.7 7.6-13.1.0-8.4-6.8-15.1-15.1-15.1h-58.3c-3.4.0-6.4 2.1-7.5 5.3l-.4 1.2c-4.4 12.5-18.2 19-30.6 14.6s-19-18.2-14.6-30.6l.4-1.2zM224 352a32 32 0 1164 0 32 32 0 11-64 0z"/></svg>
<span>Why is AES-256 quantum-secure?</span></div><div class=admonition-content><p>Ever wondered why we use AES-256 instead of AES-128?</p><p>The &ldquo;256&rdquo; refers to the number of key bits, resulting in \(2^{256}\) possible keys.

<span>If PQ/T hybrids are preferable, what about a hybrid signature scheme?</span></div><div class=admonition-content><p>Yes, there are also <a href=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-prabel-jose-pq-composite-sigs/02/>efforts to standardize a combination of ML-DSA and ECDSA</a>. Other than X-Wing, this is in an earlier phase, though. We are closely following developments in this area and will probably make use of this scheme once it is ready.</p></div></div><h2 id=standardizing-cryptography>Standardizing Cryptography</h2><h3 id=benefits-of-standardization>Benefits of Standardization</h3><p>In every industry, standardization plays a key role. It ensures compatibility, promotes interoperability, and reduces costs by enabling different systems and organizations to work together using common protocols and specifications—maintaining consistency and reliability.</p><p>In the security sector, standardization is even more critical. Algorithms, protocols, and data formats must not only function reliably across heterogeneous systems—they must also withstand rigorous scrutiny. The more experts peer review a standard, the better. As with the NIST competitions mentioned earlier, such scrutiny can uncover weaknesses <em>before</em> a cipher is deployed in production. By adhering to established, transparent standards, both developers and users benefit from stronger, more trustworthy protection—especially as the threat landscape evolves with technologies like quantum computing.</p><p>Ignoring such standards—sometimes in the name of speed or convenience—sets you on a path that may be paved with hidden flaws. Even the smallest change can introduce serious vulnerabilities that, without thorough peer reviews, are likely to be discovered first by someone smarter and less well-intentioned.</p><p>At Cryptomator, we&rsquo;ve always stood against &ldquo;security through obscurity&rdquo; (which is also <a href=/guides/open-source/>why open source matters</a>). Needless to say, we&rsquo;ve never used home-cooked ciphers—that would pose a serious risk. And the more widely used an algorithm or protocol is, the easier it becomes to understand, verify, and audit the system as a whole.</p><h3 id=a-strong-foundation>A Strong Foundation</h3><p>Many standards are built upon others. Without ML-KEM, there would be no X-Wing. Now that X-Wing is around the corner, what can we do with it? Use it in yet another standard: <a href=https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9180.html>HPKE</a>.</p><p>HPKE stands for Hybrid Public Key Encryption—and to be precise, it doesn&rsquo;t depend on X-Wing at all. Instead, it defines how to combine three different cryptographic ingredients—KEM, KDF, and AEAD—in a specific way that ensures well-defined security properties. And X-Wing can serve as one of these ingredients (the KEM).</p><p>Another standard that we&rsquo;ve come to love is JWE, a data format for exchanging encrypted payloads. And guess what—there are people working on <a href=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-reddy-cose-jose-pqc-hybrid-hpke-07>standardizing the use of X-Wing-based HPKE in JWE</a>. That&rsquo;s exactly what we want to adopt in Cryptomator Hub, replacing the current ECDH-based JWEs.</p><p>Beyond the aforementioned benefits of peer reviews, adopting standardized formats over proprietary ones provides several additional advantages:</p><ul><li>Common APIs make it easy to swap out implementations—for example, HPKE usage remains the same regardless of the underlying algorithms.</li><li>Wide availability of well-established libraries. For instance, there are dozens of JWE/JWT libraries.</li><li>Official test vectors allows us to write tests that fail the build early if something goes wrong.</li><li>Faster vulnerabilities awareness: If a flaw is discovered in a widely used standard, it will likely be reported quickly—whereas a single proprietary implementation may go unnoticed for much longer.</li></ul><p>Both JWE and HPKE support interchangeable internal algorithms while maintaining a consistent external interface. This allows us to retain the overall structure and quickly replace internal components if vulnerabilities arise.</p><div class="admonition quote"><div class=admonition-header><svg viewBox="0 0 448 512"><path d="M448 296c0 66.3-53.7 120-120 120h-8c-17.7.0-32-14.3-32-32s14.3-32 32-32h8c30.9.0 56-25.1 56-56v-8h-64c-35.3.0-64-28.7-64-64v-64c0-35.3 28.7-64 64-64h64c35.3.0 64 28.7 64 64v32 32 72zm-256 0c0 66.3-53.7 120-120 120h-8c-17.7.0-32-14.3-32-32s14.3-32 32-32h8c30.9.0 56-25.1 56-56v-8H64c-35.3.0-64-28.7-64-64v-64c0-35.3 28.7-64 64-64h64c35.3.0 64 28.7 64 64v32 32 72z"/></svg>
<span>Quote</span></div><div class=admonition-content><p>The moral is the need for cryptographic agility. It’s not enough to implement a single standard; it’s vital that our systems be able to easily swap in new algorithms when required.</p><p>— <a href=https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2022/08/nists-post-quantum-cryptography-standards.html>Bruce Schneier</a></p></div></div><h3 id=standardizing-the-vault-format>Standardizing the Vault Format</h3><p>So, if all the ciphers used in Cryptomator products—as well as the exchange of secrets in Cryptomator Hub—are based on standards, what about the vault format?</p><p>While we use well-established cryptography, the file formats themselves are our own. But we want to change that. Some time ago, we joined forces with developers of Cyberduck, gocryptfs, and rclone to derive a common format for encrypted directories—ensuring interoperability across our tools. Although the format is still a work in progress, we hope to share more details with you in a couple of months. In the meantime, you&rsquo;re of course invited to review the format and contribute ideas for improvement on <a href=https://github.com/encryption-alliance/unified-vault-format>GitHub</a>.</p><p>One key benefit of this <em>Unified Vault Format</em> is that it enables key rotation—which itself brings two major advantages:</p><ol><li><strong>Access revocation</strong>: After rotating keys, former vault members can no longer decrypt files added after their access got revoked. What is trivial with access control lists requires special care when we want to enforce this cryptographically.</li><li><strong>Cipher agility</strong>: To some extent, it enables cipher upgrades. For example, if a vulnerability is found in one algorithm, we can flip a switch and transition to a new JWE algorithm—instantly protecting all newly added files.</li></ol><h2 id=in-short-where-do-we-stand>In Short: Where Do We Stand?</h2><h3 id=cryptomator>Cryptomator</h3><p>As explained above, Cryptomator is already quantum-secure. Since it uses only symmetric ciphers with sufficiently large key spaces, quantum computers currently pose no known threat.</p><h3 id=cryptomator-hub>Cryptomator Hub</h3><p>Cryptomator Hub, on the other hand, will need to migrate to different algorithms. These are the steps we want to take:</p><ol><li><em>(In progress)</em> Implement X-Wing: As a 100% open-source company, we have always contributed to other libraries and projects. As mentioned before, we&rsquo;re in contact with the authors of the <a href=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-connolly-cfrg-xwing-kem/>X-Wing RFC</a> and also with the JDK security team in order to add <a href=https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/pull/26032>X-Wing support in the OpenJDK</a>.</li><li><em>(In progress)</em> Implement HPKE in JWE libraries: We have been contributing to one of the most widely used <a href=https://connect2id.com/products/nimbus-jose-jwt>JOSE libraries for Java</a> from the very beginning of Cryptomator. Unsurprisingly, it is therefore in our interest to add HPKE support (and then X-Wing based HPHKE) as defined in <a href=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-reddy-cose-jose-pqc-hybrid-hpke-07>JOSE HPKE RFC</a>. The RFC authors (one of whom we know personally) are already eager to hear our feedback.</li><li>Migrate the JWEs used in Cryptomator Hub from traditional to PQ/T hybrid cryptography. We want to start this as soon as the standards are finalized and the aforementioned algorithm implementations can be published in upstream libraries.</li><li>Introduce a new vault format that will improve the cipher agility and has further benefits for Cryptomator Hub users.</li></ol><p>As you can see this is a collaborative effort.

Users can now mutually verify each other&rsquo;s identities by signing public keys. This creates a network of trust that protects against the injection of manipulated or forged public keys.</p><p>This feature directly addresses so-called <strong>&ldquo;key injection&rdquo; risks</strong> and strengthens the protection of sensitive data across organizations.</p><p>The verification process is based on a simple but effective principle: <strong>Only when a person’s public key is confirmed by trusted peers is their identity considered verified.</strong></p><p>Admins can configure how many verifications are required.</p><h2 id=new-create-vaults-role-granular-permissions-for-vault-creation>New Create-Vaults Role: Granular Permissions for Vault Creation</h2><p>With the introduction of the new <code>create-vaults</code> role, admins now have full control over who is allowed to create new vaults within the organization.</p><p>Previously, this permission was available to all users by default — now, admins can specify whether only certain teams, individuals, or everyone should have access to this feature.</p><p>Especially in large organizations, this is a key improvement for maintaining order and managing infrastructure growth in a more controlled way.</p><h2 id=audit-log-even-more-precise-activity-tracking>Audit Log: Even More Precise Activity Tracking</h2><figure class=text-center><img class="inline-block rounded-sm max-h-[553px]" src=/img/blog/hub-1.4.0-auditlog.png alt="Hub 1.4.0 Audit Log"></figure><p>Monitoring security-relevant actions is a key responsibility in IT operations. With version 1.4.0, the <strong>audit log</strong> becomes even more powerful:</p><ul><li><strong>Filter by event type:</strong> You can now filter audit log entries by type — such as key changes, access attempts, or account activity — to quickly isolate relevant data during incidents.</li><li><strong>New events:</strong> Several new <a href=https://docs.cryptomator.org/hub/admin/#event-types>event types</a> were added to better capture security-critical actions.<ul><li><strong>Register Device</strong> – A user registered a new device, e.g., Cryptomator app or browser session.</li><li><strong>Remove Device</strong> – A user removed a device.</li><li><strong>Signed Identity</strong> – A user signed another user’s identity.</li><li><strong>Account Key Changed</strong> – A user regenerated their account key, which also affects user keys.</li><li><strong>Reset User Account</strong> – A user reset their account.</li><li><strong>User Keys Change</strong> – A user changed their keys, e.g., during initial setup or account key updates.</li><li><strong>Claim Vault Ownership</strong> – A user claimed ownership of a vault that was created with a Hub version prior to 1.3.0 using the Vault Admin Password.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Retrieve Vault Key event enhanced:</strong> This audit event now includes the <strong>IP address and device ID</strong> — making it easier to trace who unlocked a vault and from which device.</li></ul><h2 id=more-transparency-in-user-profile>More Transparency in User Profile</h2><figure class=text-center><img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src=/img/blog/hub-1.4.0-profile.png alt="Hub 1.4.0 Profile View"></figure><p>The user interface has also been updated to offer more transparency about devices and access patterns:</p><ul><li><strong>Legacy devices:</strong> Users can now see if they’re still using devices linked to vaults created with older versions of the Hub. This helps with migrations to the current user-key-based encryption introduced in version 1.3.0.</li><li><strong>Last IP and vault access timestamp:</strong> The device overview now shows the <strong>last known IP address</strong> and the <strong>most recent vault access timestamp</strong> for each device — ideal for identifying suspicious activity.</li></ul><h2 id=new-languages-and-improved-usability>New Languages and Improved Usability</h2><ul><li><strong>More language support:</strong> Cryptomator Hub is now available in <strong>Dutch, French, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Turkish</strong> — making it even more accessible for international teams.</li><li><strong>Language preference is preserved:</strong> Your selected language setting is now saved in your user profile and no longer resets after logout.</li></ul><h2 id=provenance-attestation-for-container-images>Provenance Attestation for Container Images</h2><p>A frequently overlooked but critical area of security is the <strong>authenticity of software containers</strong>. Starting with version 1.4.0, we now publish <strong>provenance attestations</strong> for our container images.</p><p>These attestations document the origin and integrity of our images and provide additional assurance for automated deployments and CI/CD pipelines.</p><h2 id=full-changelog>Full Changelog</h2><p>All technical details, fixes, and improvements can be found in the <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/hub/releases/tag/1.4.0>release notes</a> and the new <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/hub/blob/1.4.0/CHANGELOG.md>CHANGELOG</a> file.</p><h2 id=closing-remarks>Closing Remarks</h2><p><strong>Cryptomator Hub 1.4.0</strong> is a release that builds trust — through greater visibility, more refined controls, and solid technical foundations.</p><p>Whether it’s security management, role-based permissions, or user-facing transparency: This update lays the groundwork for even more robust data infrastructures in organizations that take encryption seriously.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Spring Sale: 25%* Off Cryptomator – Until World Backup Day!</h2><p>Spring is here – and so is our Spring Sale!

Many companies promise secure encryption, but recent events show that this protection is often insufficient or compromised by government mandates.</p><h2 id=apple-complies-with-uk-government-demand>Apple Complies with UK Government Demand</h2><p>Apple has announced that it will no longer offer its &ldquo;Advanced Data Protection&rdquo; (ADP) service, which provides enhanced end-to-end encryption for iCloud data, in the United Kingdom. This decision follows an order from the UK government under the &ldquo;Investigatory Powers Act&rdquo; of 2016, which requires Apple to provide access to encrypted user data.</p><p>Rather than implementing a direct backdoor for the government, Apple has chosen to make ADP unavailable to UK users. This means that files stored in iCloud, iMessage chats, and photos will no longer be protected with the highest available encryption standard. Apple has justified this step as a necessary response to legal requirements—highlighting that even major tech corporations cannot escape regulatory pressure.</p><p>In an official statement, Apple reiterated that the company has &ldquo;never created a backdoor or a master key to any of our products or services […].&rdquo; Similar measures are not planned for the future. Furthermore, Apple emphasized that it is &ldquo;more urgent than ever&rdquo; to secure cloud files with end-to-end encryption. The company hopes to reintroduce the feature in the UK in the future.</p><p>Existing users in the UK must now disable end-to-end encryption, while new users will no longer be able to enable the feature. Apple itself cannot deactivate the encryption, as doing so would contradict the principles of end-to-end security. However, certain cloud services such as passwords, health data, and payment information will remain end-to-end encrypted.</p><p>This development sends a strong signal: Those who want to keep their data truly private should not rely solely on cloud providers&rsquo; promises but instead take independent action.</p><h2 id=why-you-should-take-data-encryption-into-your-own-hands>Why You Should Take Data Encryption Into Your Own Hands</h2><p>The Apple case demonstrates that even well-intentioned security measures can be quickly undermined. The implications of such government demands are far-reaching:</p><ul><li><strong>Provider Access to Data:</strong> Apple may be forced to make further concessions regarding data security in the future.</li><li><strong>Apple Sets a Precedent:</strong> The UK may be a single case for now, but other governments could follow suit with similar demands.</li><li><strong>Data Breaches and Hacks:</strong> Even if a provider does not introduce intentional backdoors, new infrastructure requirements can create unintended vulnerabilities.</li></ul><p>To mitigate these risks, users should take responsibility for encrypting their data before uploading it to the cloud.</p><h3 id=practical-steps-for-your-own-encryption>Practical Steps for Your Own Encryption</h3><ul><li><strong>Encrypt Data Before Uploading:</strong> Tools like Cryptomator consistently use end-to-end encryption, securing your files locally before they are uploaded to the cloud. This ensures that you retain control over your data—even if your cloud provider no longer offers end-to-end encryption, as is now the case with iCloud in the UK.</li><li><strong>Use Trusted Open-Source Software:</strong> Open-source programs like Cryptomator allow independent security audits and offer transparency that proprietary software often lacks.</li><li><strong>Regular Updates and Security Checks:</strong> Keep your software up to date and conduct regular backups to prevent security vulnerabilities.</li></ul><h2 id=the-political-dimension-data-privacy-under-siege>The Political Dimension: Data Privacy Under Siege</h2><p>The UK government’s demands on Apple are not an isolated case. Governments worldwide are attempting to weaken encrypted communication:</p><ul><li><strong>The EU and Client-Side Scanning:</strong> The European Commission is discussing &ldquo;client-side scanning&rdquo; (CSS), where content is analyzed on user devices before being encrypted. This could pave the way for widespread surveillance.</li><li><strong>The US and the FBI:</strong> In the United States, the FBI has long pushed for access to encrypted devices and cloud services. Such &ldquo;backdoors&rdquo; could be exploited not only by authorities but also by cybercriminals and authoritarian regimes. Recent reports indicate that the FBI has intensified its warnings about security vulnerabilities in iPhones and Android devices, emphasizing the need for greater control over encryption to combat emerging cyber threats.</li><li><strong>Australia and the Decryption Law:</strong> Australia&rsquo;s &ldquo;Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Act&rdquo; requires companies to provide technical solutions for decryption upon government request. This law could set a global precedent for weakened security standards.</li></ul><h2 id=conclusion-personal-responsibility-is-the-best-protection>Conclusion: Personal Responsibility is the Best Protection</h2><p>These recent developments make it clear that users should not blindly trust cloud providers&rsquo; security promises. Taking responsibility for your own encryption is the only way to ensure that private data remains truly private.</p><p>With the right tools and methods, anyone can effectively protect their data from unauthorized access—and reclaim a piece of digital sovereignty.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator 1.15.0 is here!</h2><p>We are excited to introduce the latest version of Cryptomator, version 1.15.0!

Let’s take a closer look at the highlights of this release.</p><h2 id=whats-new>What’s New?</h2><h3 id=improved-user-interface>Improved User Interface</h3><ul><li><strong>Redesigned Main Window</strong>: The main window has been revamped to better integrate the app into the system and its design. Additionally, the new layout enhances navigation and groups essential functions so that they are more easily accessible to users.</li><li><strong>Compact Vault List</strong>: The vault list now offers a compact view, which can be enabled in the settings.

A huge thank you to our community for this contribution. If you’d like to help with translations, visit us <a href=https://translate.cryptomator.org>here</a>.</li><li><strong>Zero Dependency AppImage</strong>: The AppImage no longer requires libfuse (version 2) to start. This makes the AppImage fully self-contained and compatible with almost all Linux systems.</li><li><strong>Certificate Store</strong>: Cryptomator now uses the system’s certificate stores (macOS, Windows) or a custom PKCS12 file (Linux) for HTTPS connections. This change ensures better compatibility with enterprise environments where custom certificates are used.</li><li><strong>Improved Error Handling When Unlocking</strong>: If a vault is read-only, this is now indicated to the user, and a retry in read-only mode is possible. This ensures greater transparency, prevents unexpected issues, and allows access to files even in restricted environments.</li></ul><h2 id=bugfixes>Bugfixes</h2><ul><li>A bug in the <strong>cryptographic file system</strong> has been fixed. In very rare cases, the cryptographic content of a file became corrupted when writing and truncating simultaneously. The bug was discovered through our automated tests and was quickly resolved.</li><li><strong>Supporter Certificate Management</strong>: It is now possible to manage the supporter certificate. Once entered, it is hidden if valid and can only be removed. This prevents easy marking and copying, enhancing certificate security.</li><li>Vaults can be added to <strong>Dolphin’s Quick Access</strong> again. This makes navigation and access to encrypted files easier for KDE users.</li></ul><h2 id=other-changes>Other Changes</h2><ul><li><strong>Updated to JDK 23</strong> and <strong>JavaFX 23.0.1</strong> for better performance and stability, ensuring compatibility with modern development standards.</li><li><strong>Updated translations</strong> for many supported languages, ensuring a better user experience across different regions.</li></ul><h2 id=update-now>Update Now!</h2><p>Cryptomator 1.15.0 is now available!

This update focuses primarily on bug fixes for a smoother user experience. Let’s take a closer look at the details:</p><h2 id=whats-new>What’s New?</h2><p><strong>FUSE-T: Now Default with SMB Backend</strong></p><p>Cryptomator continues to evolve, offering better performance and seamless system integration. With this update, FUSE-T now defaults to the SMB backend, ensuring more reliable file operations on macOS 15.0.0.</p><h2 id=bugfixes>Bugfixes</h2><p>We’ve worked hard to resolve reported issues and make Cryptomator even more stable:</p><p><strong>Cache Invalidation for Directories</strong></p><p>CryptoFS includes a cache for performance reasons, which maps plaintext names to encrypted directories. A bug caused the cache not to invalidate correctly after directories were moved or deleted. This update fixes the issue, ensuring that directory listings are always accurate.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Server Connection Interrupted&rdquo;</strong></p><p>On macOS 15.0.0, frequent connection interruptions between the system and an open vault were reported when using FUSE-T. These interruptions appeared as &ldquo;Server Connection Interrupted&rdquo; dialogs. Switching to SMB as the default backend has mitigated this issue while also improving performance.</p><p><strong>Quick Access Fix for GNOME Nautilus</strong></p><p>An issue causing invalid quick-access entries in GNOME Nautilus has been resolved.</p><p><strong>Filesystem Consistency</strong></p><p>A previously theoretical issue that could lead to an inconsistent filesystem has been fixed. Previously, this could only be resolved by manually locking and unlocking the vault.</p><h2 id=other-changes>Other Changes</h2><p>We’ve also updated the Thai translation to ensure Cryptomator speaks the language more fluently.</p><h2 id=closing-remarks>Closing Remarks</h2><p>We are continuously working to improve Cryptomator for our community.

Until now, users could verify others, but now we&rsquo;re taking it a step further: once a verification is made, it&rsquo;s automatically signed and shared, making it possible for others to see when someone has been marked as trustworthy. This creates a network where trust and authenticity become visible.</p><p>This feature allows teams to see at a glance how trustworthy someone is within the network, based on prior verifications by other users.

Previously, anyone in the Hub could create new vaults, but now, permissions can be finely configured. For instance, admins can decide that only certain departments, such as IT or HR, can create new vaults. This function ensures clear structure, prevents unwanted vaults, and adapts to your organization&rsquo;s unique needs. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for larger teams.</p><h2 id=test-the-beta-now>Test the Beta Now!</h2><p>These features are available in the beta version and are waiting for you to try them out.

Previously, pCloud users encountered the issue where the &ldquo;last modified&rdquo; date was incorrectly set to &ldquo;today&rdquo; whenever a file was copied into a vault. We’ve fixed this problem in Cryptomator’s native file system, CryptoFS. The fix also addressed issues with other cloud providers/storage locations (including FAT32-formatted USB sticks).</p><p><strong>Microsoft Office and Dropbox</strong></p><p>Editing Microsoft Office documents in a Dropbox vault on Windows occasionally led to data loss. The reason: The &ldquo;WinFsp&rdquo; drive type is incompatible with both Microsoft Office and Dropbox, but &ldquo;WinFsp&rdquo; is the default on Windows. From now on, the correct type, &ldquo;WinFsp (Local Drive),&rdquo; is automatically selected when you create or import a new Dropbox vault.

This is the final step in the verification process, and once submitted, we anticipate that Google Drive access will be restored shortly thereafter.</p><p>We are cautiously optimistic that full functionality will be available again within the next few days. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this has caused and appreciate your continued patience and understanding as we work through this final stage.</p><hr><p>Hello Community!</p><p>We would like to inform you about a current issue that some of you may be experiencing while using our Cryptomator apps for Android and iOS. It involves difficulties in connecting to Google Drive that have arisen in the past few days. Here, you will find all the details and updates on our progress in resolving the issue.</p><h2 id=what-happened>What Happened?</h2><p>Google recently introduced significant changes to its app verification system. These changes particularly affect how apps access services like Google Drive. As a result of this update, you may encounter an error message when trying to connect Google Drive with Cryptomator, stating that Cryptomator is blocked because it is an &ldquo;unverified app&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=why-is-this-issue-occurring>Why Is This Issue Occurring?</h2><p>Google has substantially tightened the requirements for app verification, especially for apps that access sensitive user data. This not only affects Cryptomator but potentially all apps that integrate with Google services. The aim of these changes is to enhance user security and protect their data. However, as a consequence, apps that have not yet fully adapted to the new system may be temporarily blocked.</p><h2 id=what-are-we-doing-to-resolve-the-issue>What Are We Doing to Resolve the Issue?</h2><p>We are fully aware of the problem and are working diligently to find a solution. Our team is in close contact with Google to complete the necessary verification processes and re-certify Cryptomator as a trusted app. Unfortunately, this task is more complex than initially anticipated. Google&rsquo;s new requirements necessitate additional adjustments to our app, which must be carefully implemented and tested.</p><p>We want to emphasize that the security of your data is our top priority. Therefore, we are taking the time to thoroughly implement these changes to ensure that Cryptomator remains a secure and reliable solution for your encrypted data.</p><h2 id=what-can-you-do>What Can You Do?</h2><p>We understand that this issue is frustrating for many of you, and we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do to avoid interrupting your workflow:</p><ol><li>Use Alternative Cloud Services: If you cannot use Google Drive at the moment, you have the option to integrate alternative cloud services like Dropbox, OneDrive, or WebDAV-based services in Cryptomator.</li><li>Local Decryption: You can still decrypt your encrypted vaults using the desktop application. If the vault is not that large, you can also download it to your mobile device and decrypt it locally.</li><li>Monitor Updates: We will keep you regularly informed about the progress of our work. As soon as the issue is resolved, we will promptly notify you with the corresponding updates. Keep an eye on our social media accounts on X and Mastodon for updates.</li></ol><h2 id=outlook>Outlook</h2><p>We are confident that we will be able to provide a solution soon. Our goal is to restore full functionality to Cryptomator as quickly as possible. We greatly appreciate your patience and understanding during this time.</p><p>Once again, thank you for your support and trust in Cryptomator. We are working tirelessly to provide you with the best possible experience with our app, and we will keep you informed as soon as there are any updates.</p><p>Best regards,<br>The Cryptomator Team</p><h2 id=faq-google-oauth-issues-in-cryptomator-for-android-and-ios>FAQ: Google OAuth Issues in Cryptomator for Android and iOS</h2><p><strong>Q1: What is the issue with Google Drive and Cryptomator for Android and iOS?</strong><br><strong>A1:</strong> Users are experiencing issues with Google blocking access to your files when using Cryptomator for Android and iOS during the sign-in process.</p><p><strong>Q2: How can I access my files? Is there a workaround?</strong><br><strong>A2:</strong> You can always access your files on your Desktop computer or by copying your vault from your Google Drive to your phone&rsquo;s harddrive and then using Cryptomator for Android and iOS to access them locally.</p><p><strong>Q3: Are my files safe? Is my account safe?</strong><br><strong>A3:</strong> Yes. Your files and account both are safe and at no risk of being deleted or accessed by malicious actors. They are not any less safe than they were a week ago.
Also your files are still encrypted.</p><p><strong>Q4: Is there a problem with my Google account?</strong><br><strong>A4:</strong> No. This is not a problem with your Google account and this should affect all users of Cryptomator for Android and iOS and Google Drive.</p><p><strong>Q5: Is Cryptomator for Android and iOS safe?</strong><br><strong>A5:</strong> Yes. Cryptomator for Android is safe and we are currently not aware of any security issues.
Also see <strong>Q7.</strong></p><p><strong>Q6: Which &ldquo;sensitive info&rdquo; is Cryptomator for Android and iOS trying to access?</strong><br><strong>A6:</strong> To allow access to the files you have stored in Google Drive and to enable the associated functionality, the Cryptomator app needs access to your Google Drive.
Even if the message from Google sounds scary, this is nothing new and nothing to worry about.
Also see <strong>Q7.</strong></p><p><strong>Q7: Why is this happening? Why is Google blocking Cryptomator for Android and iOS?</strong><br><strong>A7:</strong> To enable access to your files stored in Google Drive, Cryptomator needs both your permission and Google&rsquo;s consent. Google has recently adopted newer and stricter security policies that we must adhere to in order to continue to provide access to your Google Drive in the app. If we don&rsquo;t prove to Google in time that we comply with these guidelines, access will be blocked, which is what is happening right now. We are currently in the middle of this verification process to regain access, but this is quite time-consuming and labor-intensive, all of which has led to this situation.</p><p><strong>Q8: What about Cryptomator for Desktop?</strong><br><strong>A8:</strong> The affected functionality is not offered by Cryptomator for Desktop, so there currently is no problem there.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator Hub 1.3.0: The Account Key Update</h2><p>The release of Cryptomator Hub 1.3.0 marks an exciting feature update, which introduces an <em>Account Key</em> for users. This update, while necessary and beneficial, will require active participation from users. Here&rsquo;s what to expect during the transition from version 1.2.x to 1.3.0.</p><h2 id=information_source-preparation-is-key>&#8505;&#xfe0f; Preparation is Key</h2><p>Before we dive into the upgrade process, ensure every vault admin secures a backup of their <em>Vault Recovery Keys</em> and <em>Vault Admin Passwords</em>. <strong>&#9888;&#xfe0f; Doubling down on this step is critical; your backups are your safety net. Without them, our hands are tied.</strong></p><h2 id=arrow_up-updating-cryptomator-hub-server-to-130>&#x2b06;&#xfe0f; Updating Cryptomator Hub (Server) to 1.3.0</h2><p>This section is only relevant for administrators who host their own Cryptomator Hub instance. If you&rsquo;re using our managed service, you can skip this section. We will reach out to you to arrange a date and time to update your instance.</p><p>As mentioned above, if you&rsquo;re an administrator of a self-hosted Cryptomator Hub instance, follow these steps to update Cryptomator Hub:</p><ol><li><a href=https://docs.cryptomator.org/hub/deployment/#backup>Back up the database</a>. <strong>&#9888;&#xfe0f; The importance of a working backup cannot be overstated.</strong></li><li>Refresh your container image to the latest version: <code>ghcr.io/cryptomator/hub:1.3.0</code><ul><li>Skip this step if you&rsquo;re using the <code>stable</code> tag. We will update the <code>stable</code> tag to point to the new version in a couple of weeks.</li></ul></li><li>Implement the changes within your container orchestrator. Monitor for healthy pod statuses before proceeding.</li></ol><h2 id=arrow_up-updating-cryptomator-desktop-client-to-1110>&#x2b06;&#xfe0f; Updating Cryptomator (Desktop Client) to 1.11.0</h2><p>Updating the Cryptomator desktop application is recommended for all users, but not technically required for now. Vaults can still be unlocked using an old version. This backward compatibility provides flexibility for a gradual rollout of the updated app. Nevertheless, making changes to access, incl. adding new members to a vault and adding new devices, requires Cryptomator 1.11.0 or higher.</p><h2 id=key-introducing-account-keys>&#x1f511; Introducing Account Keys</h2><p>With the updated app, users will encounter a two-step migration on their first unlock attempt:</p><ol><li>Secure and store their new personal <em>Account Key</em>. <strong>&#9888;&#xfe0f; It&rsquo;s crucial for future logins from other devices.</strong></li><li>Use the <em>Account Key</em> to link their Cryptomator device to their account.</li></ol><p>This procedure is a one-time requirement for every user. It allows users to self-manage linked devices and vault owners to more easily manage access without having to frequently regrant permissions each time a user logs in from a new device.</p><h2 id=bust_in_silhouette-claiming-vault-ownership-and-granting-access>&#x1f464; Claiming Vault Ownership and Granting Access</h2><p>After updating to Hub 1.3.0, vault owners (formerly known as vault admins) are prompted to claim their vault again using the <em>Vault Admin Password</em>. Initially, only one user can claim ownership. Subsequently, this primary owner can grant ownership rights to others, thus eliminating the need to share the <em>Vault Admin Password</em>.</p><p>Once vault members have navigated through the account migration, vault owners should refresh vault permissions. This action will securely distribute the necessary vault keys to the users.</p><h2 id=question-frequently-asked-questions>&#x2753; Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p><strong>Q: What exactly is my <em>Account Key</em>?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> The <em>Account Key</em> is your personal secret, required for registering new devices and establishing your identity across different Cryptomator apps and browsers. Treat it with the same level of security as you would with any important password.</p><p><strong>Q: How do I retrieve my <em>Account Key</em> if I lose it?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> You can retrieve your <em>Account Key</em> by logging into your Cryptomator Hub account and navigating to the <em>Profile</em> page. There, you can view your <em>Account Key</em>. If your browser doesn&rsquo;t have access and you can&rsquo;t retrieve it anymore, you can reset your account. In this case, you will lose access to all your vaults and the vault owner(s) will have to grant you access again.</p><p><strong>Q: Will the update affect my existing vaults and the data they contain?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> No, the update will not affect your vaults or the data they contain. This update only affects the unlock process and access management, not the encrypted data itself.</p><p><strong>Q: What happens to the <em>Vault Admin Password</em> after I reclaim ownership?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Upon reclaim, the <em>Vault Admin Password</em> becomes obsolete. You may destroy any copies of it. Compromised <em>Vault Admin Passwords</em> don&rsquo;t pose a threat to the security of the vault.</p><p><strong>Q: Is the process for adding new users to a vault different?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> The difference is that you don&rsquo;t grant access to each and every device, but to the user once, thanks to the <em>Account Key</em>. The user can link their devices to their account and access the vault from any of them without having to ask for permission again.</p><p><strong>Q: What should I do if I encounter problems during the upgrade process?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> If you encounter any problems during the upgrade process, please contact us at <a href=mailto:hub@cryptomator.org>hub@cryptomator.org</a>.</p><h2 id=clipboard-wrapping-up>&#x1f4cb; Wrapping Up</h2><p>The upgrade to Cryptomator Hub 1.3.0 and Cryptomator 1.11.0 is more than a routine update. It&rsquo;s a shift towards greater security and user agency. Prepare for the update by backing up essential data, and follow the outlined steps to ensure a smooth transition.

Plus, vault names no longer need to be unique, offering more flexibility.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve also added the &ldquo;Archive Vault&rdquo; action, allowing you to remove vaults from your list. Easily reactivate archived vaults whenever needed.</p><h2 id=bust_in_silhouette-streamlined-user-profile-page>&#x1f464; Streamlined User Profile Page</h2><p>Our new &ldquo;User Profile&rdquo; page centralizes device management and user settings in one convenient location. Additionally, we&rsquo;ve integrated a &ldquo;Manage Account&rdquo; link for users to be able to change their password and configure 2FA via Keycloak.</p><h2 id=arrow_up-upgrade-info>&#x2b06;&#xfe0f; Upgrade Info</h2><p>Upgrading to 1.2.0 is simple. If you are on the <code>stable</code> lane, you just have to pull the image and restart the service. Otherwise, update the version number in your Docker Compose or Kubernetes spec file before you restart the service. Remember to always <a href=https://docs.cryptomator.org/hub/deployment/#backup>back up your data</a>, especially before upgrading. For managed instances, rest assured, you&rsquo;re already on the latest version.</p><h2 id=next_track_button-whats-next>&#9197;&#xfe0f; What&rsquo;s Next</h2><p>We&rsquo;re embarking on a significant refactoring journey for our key management system in the next feature update. This update will introduce &ldquo;user keys&rdquo; as intermediary key pairs between vault keys and device keys. Vault owners will then grant access to users and not individual devices, which allows users to manage their devices independently.</p><p>This refactoring will deprecate vault admin passwords and introduce the vault owner role, providing a more secure and efficient way to manage your vaults.</p><p>Stay tuned for more exciting updates!</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator 1.8.0 for Android</h2><p>As you may have already noticed, we released Cryptomator 1.8.0 for Android last month! It contains a lot of internal changes, a bunch of new features, and some bug fixes.</p><p>This release took quite some time, but we finally made it. &#x1f389; In addition to the <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/android/releases/tag/1.8.0>release notes</a>, we&rsquo;d like to give you more details about some changes.</p><h2 id=material-3-design>Material 3 Design</h2><p>The most obvious change in this release is the migration to Material 3, which modernizes the user interface.</p><h2 id=cryptomator-lite-reproducible-build-and-f-droid>Cryptomator Lite: Reproducible Build and F-Droid</h2><p>A less obvious change is that we now offer a new flavor: Cryptomator Lite.</p><p>This version is built using a reproducible build technique, which has two advantages: You as a user can verify that the published source code matches the published binary, which in turn means that we didn&rsquo;t and couldn&rsquo;t add anything during build time.</p><p>The other advantage is that this technique allows us to publish our app to stores like the main F-Droid repository, but sign it with our keys, which means we still have control over the signing keys.</p><p>Cryptomator Lite can be built using the following Docker image and then compared to the corresponding releases: <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/android/blob/main/buildsystem/Dockerfile>https://github.com/cryptomator/android/blob/main/buildsystem/Dockerfile</a></p><h2 id=aes-gcm-new-default-for-content-encryption>AES-GCM: New Default for Content Encryption</h2><p>Starting with Cryptomator 1.8.0 for Android, we will follow our Desktop application: All newly created vaults will use <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode>AES-GCM</a> instead of AES-CTR+HMAC for file content encryption.</p><p>You can continue to use your existing vaults as before, no action is required on your part. Cryptomator for Android will support both modes of operation.</p><p>Read more about this in the <a href=/blog/2023/02/01/1-7-0-what-you-need-to-know/>Cryptomator 1.7.0 blog post</a>.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator Hub: Managed – Request Access Now</h2><p>We are happy to announce that managed instances of <a href=/hub/>Cryptomator Hub</a> are now available! &#x1f389; And we have released Hub 1.1.0 with recovery key support.</p><h2 id=request-access>Request Access</h2><p>First things first. &#x1f680; To get started, you can now <a href=/hub/managed/>request access to a managed instance of Cryptomator Hub</a>. After your request, we will get back to you as soon as possible. Currently, some of the steps we take internally to create a managed Hub instance are still done &ldquo;manually&rdquo;. We are working on automating this process, but we didn&rsquo;t want to delay the release any longer.</p><h2 id=managed-vs-self-hosted>Managed vs. Self-Hosted</h2><p>Managed instances of Cryptomator Hub are a great way to start using Cryptomator Hub right away without having to deploy and maintain your self-hosted instance.</p><p>Until now, you could <em>only</em> use the self-hosted version of Hub. This requires a lot of knowledge about how to deploy a software container using Kubernetes or Docker Compose. And if you have the knowledge, you still have to maintain the instance yourself. This includes updating the software, monitoring the instance, and keeping it secure.</p><p>With managed instances, we will take care of deploying and maintaining your Hub instance, while ensuring that your instance is highly available. You can focus on your work and your team.</p><p>This is all possible because of the underlying <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/hub/wiki/Zero-Knowledge-Key-Management>zero-knowledge key management</a>. Cryptomator Hub doesn&rsquo;t store unencrypted keys. All key material remains locally on the client. We can&rsquo;t decrypt your data. It also helps that Hub is independent of your cloud storage provider, which means we have no access to either the key material or the cloud files.</p><h2 id=release-110-recovery-key>Release 1.1.0: Recovery Key</h2><p>We didn&rsquo;t stop there and released Cryptomator Hub 1.1.0 with recovery key support. This allows you to access your data in case of disaster. Not only that, the recovery key is compatible with Cryptomator&rsquo;s recovery key. This means you can convert your existing vaults to Hub vaults and vice versa.</p><p>What does that mean for your managed instance? If we cease to exist (we get asked this a lot, thanks to Boxcryptor &#x1f609;), you can convert your Hub vaults to &ldquo;regular&rdquo; password-based vaults, completely offline, so that you <em>always</em> have access to your data under any circumstances. This is also great for your self-hosted instance if something happens to your server.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator 1.7.0: What You Need to Know</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re subscribed to our <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases>releases on GitHub</a>, this is already old news for you: We have released the <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.7.0-beta1>first beta</a> of the upcoming Cryptomator 1.7.0! It contains a lot of internal changes and a bunch of new features, some of which are almost as old as Cryptomator itself.</p><p>We are very proud of this release, as it eliminates technical debt, delivers long-awaited features, and prepares Cryptomator Desktop for the future. But putting aside about 3,000 lines of code changes and a 4-month development iteration (not counting work in our libraries), let&rsquo;s dive into this release to see what you, the user, will get out of it.</p><figure class=text-center><img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src=/img/blog/cryptomator-1-7-0.png srcset="/img/blog/cryptomator-1-7-0.png 1x, /img/blog/cryptomator-1-7-0@2x.png 2x" alt="Cryptomator 1.7.0 Release"></figure><h2 id=locate-encrypted-file>Locate Encrypted File</h2><p>As already mentioned, Cryptomator 1.7.0 includes a feature that has been requested for a very long time: Locating the encrypted counterpart of a file. Sounds complex, but once you remember that Cryptomator encrypts filenames and obfuscates the directory structure (<a href=https://docs.cryptomator.org/security/vault/#filename-encryption>see our docs</a>), it is easy to understand.</p><p>Prior to 1.7.0, you had to guess which encrypted file corresponds to which cleartext file based on the exact timestamps. Now, once the vault is unlocked, the encrypted counterpart of any file in the vault can be revealed by clicking on the &ldquo;Locate Encrypted File&rdquo; button and selecting a file in the vault. Or you can simply drag and drop the files from your vault onto this button. See for yourself in this short video:</p><video class=rounded-sm autoplay loop muted playsinline>
<source src=https://static.cryptomator.org/blog/locate-encrypted-file.mov type=video/mp4>Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><h2 id=experimental-support-for-fuse-t>Experimental Support for FUSE-T</h2><p>On macOS, Cryptomator can use two different technologies to integrate your vault into the system: macFUSE and WebDAV. Unfortunately, the WebDAV implementation on macOS is not the most reliable one. Starting with Apple Silicon Macs, it became unusable for some users who reported system freezes. To make matters worse, macFUSE, which has been the preferred option for at least 3 years, is also on its last legs. Apple has deprecated the OS APIs used by macFUSE since macOS 12.3.</p><p>For the past year, we have been desperately searching for an alternative. Our proof of concept using Apple&rsquo;s File Provider framework was not very convincing and would basically require a whole new architecture. Fortunately, you, our community, informed us about an alternative: <a href=https://www.fuse-t.org/>FUSE-T</a>.</p><p>FUSE-T is a young project that does not rely on deprecated macOS APIs and can be used as a drop-in-replacement for macFUSE. It requires a much less deep system integration than macFUSE while offering a similar performance. This makes Cryptomator ready for the medium-term future on macOS. But since FUSE-T is quite young, support for it is experimental for now. We encourage you to try it though!</p><figure class=text-center><img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src=/img/blog/preferences-fuse-t.png srcset="/img/blog/preferences-fuse-t.png 1x, /img/blog/preferences-fuse-t@2x.png 2x" alt="Experimental Support for FUSE-T"></figure><p>So, while the File Provider extension is not out of our sight, we are relieved to be able to offer you a stable system integration of your Cryptomator vaults.</p><h2 id=volume-types-overhaul>Volume Types Overhaul</h2><p>Looking at the screenshot above, you might have noticed: The volume types have changed, too. That&rsquo;s right, and that&rsquo;s because we rewrote the entire volume type selection and internal wiring logic. It was a huge development effort, but it resulted in a less complex and easier to maintain architecture under the hood. It also resulted in more options for you.</p><h3 id=more-options>More Options</h3><p>The old implementation basically offered 3 (or 2) options: WebDAV, Dokany, and FUSE. Now, specialized implementations are offered for each OS. For example, on Windows you can select between WinFsp, WinFsp (Local Drive), Dokany, WebDAV (Windows Explorer) and WebDAV (Fallback).</p><p>But don&rsquo;t worry, this selection is only important if you have special requirements for the virtual drive. Otherwise, Cryptomator has a new &ldquo;Automatic&rdquo; option and is set up to choose the best suited option for you, and you don&rsquo;t need to worry about it.</p><p>We have even added an emergency option: The aforementioned &ldquo;WebDAV (Fallback)&rdquo;. If you can&rsquo;t mount your vault at all, it makes your vault accessible via a local-only server using the web standard WebDAV. We&rsquo;ll have a guide describing this in more detail soon.</p><h3 id=winfsp-change-local-vs-network-drive>WinFsp Change: Local vs. Network Drive</h3><p>Windows users may notice that their vault is now mounted as a network drive by default. This has the advantage of better performance when listing large directories. The disadvantage is that it cannot be mounted into a directory. Accessing the vault as a privileged user is still possible by using the UNC path.</p><figure class=text-center><img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src=/img/blog/winfsp-change.png srcset="/img/blog/winfsp-change.png 1x, /img/blog/winfsp-change@2x.png 2x" alt="WinFsp Change: Local vs. Network Drive"></figure><p>If you really need a local drive, you can always change the volume type in the preferences.</p><h3 id=dokany-deprecation>Dokany Deprecation</h3><p>With the release of Cryptomator 1.7.0, we will officially deprecate Dokany support.</p><p><a href=https://dokan-dev.github.io/>Dokany</a>, like FUSE, provides a file system interface to mount virtual drives without requiring elevated privileges. We started supporting Dokany 3 years ago with version 1.4.0. But things didn&rsquo;t go as smoothly with the Dokany volume as we had hoped, so we decided to focus our development efforts on a single file system interface. All Dokany-related issues on GitHub will be closed, and our general recommendation is to use WinFSP which comes with the EXE installer of Cryptomator. You will still be able to use Dokany, but it won&rsquo;t get any updates and support will eventually be removed.</p><p>It was a great time, and we wish the Dokany project all the best!</p><h2 id=linux-aarch64-builds>Linux AArch64 Builds</h2><p>With Cryptomator 1.7.0, we&rsquo;ll finally ship AArch64 builds of Cryptomator via Flatpak and PPA.</p><p>One big obstacle was the aforementioned FUSE file system API on Linux. We were using a rather old project to build the bridge between Cryptomator and FUSE. Thanks to a fantastic development effort started by our lead architect, we now use state-of-the-art technology to implement this bridge. The result is bundled in the library called <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/jfuse>jFUSE</a>. Not only were we able to change the bridge, we were also able to update to a new major version of FUSE and pave the way to support features like extended attributes.</p><p>The AppImage is still x86_x64 only, but we plan to deliver it also in AArch64 architecture eventually.</p><h2 id=aes-gcm-new-default-for-content-encryption>AES-GCM: New Default for Content Encryption</h2><p>Starting with Cryptomator 1.7.0, newly created vaults will use <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode>AES-GCM</a> instead of AES-CTR+HMAC for file content encryption.</p><p>Nowadays, almost all non-embedded devices offer hardware acceleration of the Galois/Counter Mode of operation, so encryption and decryption should be significantly faster than in the old mode of operation. The support in our underlying cryptographic library <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptolib>cryptolib</a> was already added in June 2021 with version 2.0.0. But instead of jumping the gun, we gave it a proper testing period and are now confident to ship this improvement to you.</p><p>Of course, our mobile apps also support AES-GCM, although vaults created in iOS or Android will continue to use AES-CTR+HMAC for the time being. The mobile apps are scheduled to switch in their next minor release.</p><p>You can continue to use your existing vaults as before. There are no vault upgrades and there is no action required on your part. Cryptomator will support both modes of operation.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Boxcryptor Shuts Down – Here is Your Cloud Encryption Alternative</h2><p>As mentioned in the <a href=/blog/2022/11/30/congratulations-boxcryptor-dropbox/>last blog post</a>, Dropbox has acquired Boxcryptor&rsquo;s key technology.

We are still the same team, with the same goals, and the same vision. <a href=https://skymatic.de/>Skymatic GmbH</a> will continue to develop and maintain Cryptomator and we will continue to provide you with a free and open-source solution for end-to-end encryption. &#x1f680;</p><p>The concept behind Cryptomator does not depend on any single cloud provider and we will continue to support as many cloud providers as we can.</p><p>Cryptomator is an application that runs solely on the device and does not require any infrastructure from the vendor. This means that even if Skymatic GmbH ceases to operate, existing and new users can continue to use Cryptomator.</p><p>Again and again, we have observed many times how proprietary services can be influenced by acquisitions in a very sensitive manner. Our belief is that the right to digital self-defense cannot simply be sold. This is not the only reason why Cryptomator relies on open-source licenses. GPLv3 (a copyleft license) guarantees that even in the event of an acquisition, the technology cannot be taken off the market.</p><p>With open-source tools, it has been shown in the past that a fork of the application can coexist or replace the actual app if it no longer exists. This means that even if Skymatic GmbH, together with the community, stops developing Cryptomator or sells Cryptomator to a third party, it is very likely that one of the many forks of Cryptomator will continue to be actively maintained and developed by the community.</p><h2 id=what-does-this-mean-for-dropbox-users>What does this mean for Dropbox users?</h2><p>It&rsquo;s probably too early to tell but Dropbox plans to offer end-to-end encryption to its business users only.

With this roadmap, we want to give you an overview of what has changed in Cryptomator and what you can look forward to in the coming months.</p><h2 id=ios-version>iOS Version</h2><p>At the end of last year, we were finally able to introduce our new iOS app. One of the main features is the full integration with Apple&rsquo;s own Files app. We also made it possible to offer you a &ldquo;freemium&rdquo; version of the app. If you want to know even more about the new features, check out this <a href=https://cryptomator.org/blog/2021/12/21/ios-2.0/>blog post</a>. Since then, we&rsquo;ve been working on bringing you more features through several updates, such as the auto-lock feature that came with version 2.1.0. With the just released version 2.2.0, we integrated pCloud and added support for shortcuts in Google Drive.</p><p>We have a lot more planned for the app in the coming months. We will integrate Cryptomator into <a href=https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios>Shortcuts</a> so that automation processes such as &ldquo;auto photo upload&rdquo; are possible. We also plan to integrate S3, as we did with our Android app.</p><h2 id=android-version>Android Version</h2><p>Over the past few months, we have been working on increasing the compatibility of Cryptomator. This includes the fact that we now support pCloud, S3, and Vault Format 8. Thanks again Manuel (mjenny on GitHub) for contributing support for pCloud and S3. Also, Cryptomator can now be installed and updated via F-Droid. Vaults in Google Drive can now be used via shortcuts in locations outside of &ldquo;My Drive&rdquo;. This works in &ldquo;Shared with Me&rdquo;, &ldquo;My Computer&rdquo;, and &ldquo;My Drive&rdquo; for example. With OneDrive, it is possible to use multiple accounts at the same time. We will make this feature available for Dropbox and Google Drive in the future. In addition, a &ldquo;real&rdquo; auto photo upload is available in the Android version, meaning new pictures and videos are now uploaded not only after unlocking the vault, but directly when it is unlocked.</p><p>In the coming months, we will switch the Android app to a freemium model, as we did with iOS, and continue to work on the long-awaited document provider.</p><h2 id=desktop-version>Desktop Version</h2><p>With version 1.6.0 announced in the last roadmap, we introduced Vault Format 8 for our Desktop version. You can read more about it <a href=https://cryptomator.org/blog/2021/10/11/vault-format-8/>here</a>. For better usability, we have introduced error codes and a <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/discussions/categories/errors>knowledge base</a> of those, where you can look up solutions for the issue you’ve encountered. We also introduced an auto-lock feature that automatically locks the vaults after a self-defined inactivity time as well as a plugin API. The first plugin for Cryptomator is the <a href=https://plugin.purejava.org/>KeePassXC plugin</a> via an open-source contribution by Ralph (purejava on GitHub). Furthermore, we improved our build systems so that applications/installers for all operating systems are automatically built and signed (instead of manually).</p><p>Two years ago, one might remember that we announced to focus our efforts on Flatpak distribution. However, that didn’t go as planned and progress on it came to a halt… until recently. Our regular open-source contributor Ralph (purejava on GitHub) once again came to our rescue. And we actually did it! Cryptomator is now <a href=https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.cryptomator.Cryptomator>available on Flathub as a Flatpak app</a>. Again, huge thanks to Ralph for his amazing contribution!</p><p>For the Desktop version of Cryptomator, we have some major topics coming up in the near future. On the one hand, we are working on a major FUSE refactoring. Among other things, this is necessary to be able to offer ARM64 support on Windows and Linux as well. On Apple Silicon Macs, we have already supported this for a few releases. On the other hand, we want to address the open issues related to <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/projects/13>extended attributes</a>. More precisely, we are talking about additional file attributes that enable tagging and fix compatibility issues. Of course, these attributes will be encrypted just like the filename.</p><p>If you read this far, we’d like to share a secret with you. We are currently working on <a href=https://cryptomator.org/hub/>Cryptomator Hub</a>. That’s it for now but you’ll definitely hear more about it this year.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator 1.6.7 Release: Major Changes on Windows</h2><p>Hello Community!</p><p>The last blog post is already a while ago. We hope you&rsquo;re all doing fine. Cryptomator 1.6.7 for Desktop is out now and let&rsquo;s explore the changes together since it&rsquo;s more than just a &ldquo;patch&rdquo;! The update contains some noteworthy changes, especially for Windows users.</p><h2 id=new-installer>New Installer</h2><p>With Cryptomator 1.6.0, instead of delivering a &ldquo;regular&rdquo; executable for installation, we provided a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Installer>Windows Installer package</a> to allow easier scripted deployment of Cryptomator. But this approach also had drawbacks: We couldn&rsquo;t bundle third-party drivers (i.e., Dokany) leading to inferior user experience.</p><p>These dire times are over! When you head over to <a href=/downloads/>downloads</a> and select Windows, you&rsquo;re getting an executable again that bundles the MSI installer as well as additional dependencies. Furthermore, it supports command-line parameters (e.g., <code>/quiet</code>). For a complete list, run the installer with the <code>/?</code> parameter.</p><p>If you want to download the &ldquo;pure&rdquo; MSI installer without dependencies, it&rsquo;s also available on the downloads site or head over to the <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.6.7>release on GitHub</a>.</p><h2 id=new-default-vfs-driver-virtual-volume>New Default VFS Driver (Virtual Volume)</h2><p>As already mentioned, the new EXE installer can include dependencies again, so we added one right from the start: <a href=https://winfsp.dev/>WinFsp</a>.</p><p>This decision is mainly based on the long-term maintenance effort. The integration of a vault into the OS currently supports WebDAV (legacy), Dokany (Windows), and FUSE (all systems). FUSE support (provided by WinFSP) on Windows is now available for quite a while and feedback was very promising. The time has come to make this the default choice so we can focus on a common code base.</p><p>WebDAV and Dokany will remain part of Cryptomator, should you prefer it in your individual setup. Please note that Dokany 2.x is not yet supported and our existing Dokany 1.x glue code requires a migration.</p><p>There are some known issues with WinFsp though:</p><ul><li>If you are logged in to Windows via an AzureAD account, vaults can only be accessed read-only.</li><li>Access with the admin rights is only possible when the vault is mounted into a directory (as opposed to a drive letter).</li></ul><p>If you aren&rsquo;t affected by any of these issues, we encourage you to use WinFsp/FUSE.</p><p>Those were the two major changes you should know about. For all changes, have a look at the <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.6.7>changelog</a>.</p><p>We hope you are enjoying this Cryptomator update.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Vulnerability in iOS Version 2.0.0–2.0.3 (Please update to 2.0.4)</h2><p>We always claimed that if there once were a security issue with Cryptomator, we&rsquo;d be unable to hide it. Now it happened: A user reported an issue in our iOS app that we consider severe.</p><p>While such issues can happen in any type of project (as recently demonstrated by infamous bugs in log4j and Exchange), users of open-source software can at least rely on known vulnerabilities not being kept secret for marketing purposes.</p><p>In this spirit, we want to share with you all the details of this vulnerability.</p><h2 id=what-happened>What happened?</h2><p>When decrypting files for the iOS Files app, the cleartext file needs to be physically stored on the file system and a path leading to this file is handed over to the Files app.</p><p>If iCloud Backup is enabled on this device, the cleartext file is included in the backup, effectively leaking it to Apple.</p><h2 id=what-files-are-affected>What files are affected?</h2><p>Only files that you actually opened from within the Files app have been decrypted. All remaining vault contents are unaffected.</p><p>Furthermore, the device needs to have made an iCloud Backup while a vulnerable version has been in use (2.0.0 released 2021-12-21, fixed in 2.0.4 released 2021-12-26).</p><p>If iCloud Backup is disabled, no decrypted files left your device.</p><h2 id=can-leaked-files-be-deleted-from-existing-backups>Can leaked files be deleted from existing backups?</h2><p>While we don&rsquo;t know how reliably Apple erases data, you can in fact <a href=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204247>exclude individual apps from iCloud Backup and remove existing backups</a>.</p><h2 id=when-was-the-vulnerability-reported>When was the vulnerability reported?</h2><p>The issue was <a href=https://community.cryptomator.org/t/security-issue-with-ios-app-cache-mechanism-and-icloud-backup/9167>reported by a community member on 2021-12-25 at 13:15h UTC</a>.</p><h2 id=when-was-the-vulnerability-fixed>When was the vulnerability fixed?</h2><p>We <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/ios/commit/37293a5408f48fe8e7df01b52cd436ed46af36d5>committed a fix two hours later at 15:28h UTC</a> and submitted the app to Apple immediately. Apple released the fixed version 2.0.4 on the next day.</p><h2 id=are-vaults-located-on-icloud-still-encrypted>Are vaults located on iCloud still encrypted?</h2><p>Yes, the vaults themselves are still fully protected, regardless of which cloud storage is being used.</p><h2 id=why-is-there-decrypted-data-in-the-first-place>Why is there decrypted data in the first place?</h2><p>At some point, you need to have cleartext data, otherwise you can’t work with them. Cryptomator is fully integrated into the Files app, which means that it is bound to and limited by the File Provider Extension API. It requires to have readable (cleartext) data readily available. Keep in mind that Cryptomator’s <a href=https://docs.cryptomator.org/security/security-target/>target is to ensure privacy in the cloud</a> and not on the device itself.</p><h2 id=are-there-any-other-plans-regarding-the-local-cache>Are there any other plans regarding the local cache?</h2><p>We are currently investigating if we can shorten the lifetime of decrypted data. As mentioned before, mechanisms that affect the File Provider Extension are out of our hands. But for example, <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/ios/issues/108>clearing the cache after the vault has been locked</a> in combination with <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/ios/issues/64>auto-lock</a> can certainly be helpful if you’d like to tighten the longevity of decrypted data.</p><h2 id=how-does-the-development-team-make-sure-to-avoid-issues>How does the development team make sure to avoid issues?</h2><p>While claiming to write bug-free software would be a blatant lie, we can promise to do our best to avoid such vulnerabilities.</p><p>But all the best practices, automated code analysis, highest test coverage and consulting external experts doesn&rsquo;t help to rule out all possibilities, especially when caused by interaction with a third-party tool.</p><p>The rewritten iOS app has been tested by more than 2,300 beta testers over a period of half a year. After all, it was just very bad luck that this issue has not been discovered during this beta.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator 2.0 for iOS Release</h2><p>We are happy to announce that Cryptomator 2.0 for iOS is now available <a href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cryptomator-2/id1560822163>in the App Store</a>! &#x1f389; We&rsquo;d like to express our gratitude to our over 2,300 TestFlight users for testing the app over the last 6 months. &#x2764;&#xfe0f;</p><figure class=text-center><a href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cryptomator-2/id1560822163 target=_blank rel=noopener><img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src=/img/blog/ios-2.0.png srcset="/img/blog/ios-2.0.png 1x, /img/blog/ios-2.0@2x.png 2x" alt="Cryptomator 2.0 for iOS"></a></figure><p>Last year in April, we started to rebuild our iOS app from scratch. That&rsquo;s why we decided to develop Cryptomator 2.0 in Swift. This will make it easier for us to maintain the app in the future.</p><p>Of course, the new app also comes with some new features. With Cryptomator 2.0, you get an app that is completely integrated into Apple&rsquo;s own Files app. This means that your vaults are directly accessible from there. For example, you can now save and edit a Word document directly in an encrypted vault via the Files app. In addition, features like thumbnails, grid view, swiping through images, and drag & drop are possible with the new app.</p><p>Transparency is also very important to us with Cryptomator 2.0. Therefore, the entire Cryptomator family, including the new app, remains fully open source. You can check out the repository on GitHub <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/ios>here</a>.</p><p>But we didn&rsquo;t stop there. For the first time, the new app is available as a &ldquo;freemium&rdquo; app. This means that in the free version, you can access your vaults in &ldquo;read-only&rdquo; mode. If you only need quick access to your vaults on the go, which were created with the Desktop application, then this is the perfect &ldquo;companion&rdquo; app. If you don&rsquo;t want to miss out on write access to your vaults, you can unlock the full version via a one-time purchase for $11.99 after a 30-day trial.</p><p>As promised, users of our old Cryptomator app can switch to the new app for free. We have tried to make the upgrade as easy as possible for you. All you have to do is make sure that the previous app is up to date when you start the new app so that you can select the upgrade option. To make the transition easier for you, the previous app will be available in the App Store for a short transition period.</p><p>At this point, we would like to thank you once again for your support, without which the project would not have been possible. &#x1f60a;</p><p>We are already looking forward to your feedback! &#x1f916;</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator 1.6.0: What You Need to Know</h2><p>Hello Community!</p><p>In this blog post, we&rsquo;d like to give you some news about the upcoming major update of Cryptomator to version 1.6.0.
We&rsquo;ll be highlighting the most significant changes and new features and make sure that you are ready for the update.</p><figure class=text-center><img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src=/img/blog/cryptomator-1-6-0.png srcset="/img/blog/cryptomator-1-6-0.png 1x, /img/blog/cryptomator-1-6-0@2x.png 2x" alt="Cryptomator 1.6.0 Release"></figure><h2 id=changes-and-features>Changes and Features</h2><p>The two most important changes are the usage of a new vault format (version 8) and a long promised integration of the <a href=https://community.cryptomator.org/t/sanitizer-how-to-use/43>Sanitizer</a> (now called Vault Health Check).
For a more complete list, read the <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.6.0>release page</a> of Cryptomator.</p><h3 id=auto-lock>Auto Lock</h3><p>A feature already wished in its earliest days will be present: Auto Lock – the automatic locking of a vault.
For every vault you can set up an idle timer after which the vault is automatically locked.
If any write or read happens during the time span, the timer is reset.</p><h3 id=redesigned-error-dialog>Redesigned Error Dialog</h3><p>After a lot of indirect feedback from you about the error dialog, we decided to change its design to fit more of your needs.
The most obvious and important change is the new error code.
It might be as cryptic as the already existing stack trace, but it speeds up the search for solutions or workarounds for your specific problem in our error code database.
Along with the error code the dialog also provides links to quickly query the database.
And if the error is not yet known, it&rsquo;ll make it easier for you to report it in a format that helps us understand the problem.</p><h3 id=vault-format-8>Vault Format 8</h3><p>The big change behind the scenes is a new vault format.
Starting with 1.6.0, it will be used by default and <em>enforced</em>.
The new format prepares Cryptomator for future features and corrects inconsistencies in former versions.
For more details, check out the more-in-depth <a href=https://cryptomator.org/blog/2021/10/11/vault-format-8/>article</a> about it.</p><h3 id=vault-health-check>Vault Health Check</h3><p>We added an integrated tool to detect and fix structural problems of a vault (e.g., missing directories).
Until Cryptomator 1.5.0, this task was done by the so-called <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/sanitizer>Sanitizer</a>. But the tool was hard to maintain and hard to use so that it was abandoned with the goal to integrate similar functionality directly within Cryptomator.</p><p>This plan finally bore fruit into a workflow to perform different checks on a vault to detect common problems.
The results are shown on the fly and once the check is finished, you can export the results.
For 1.6.0, there will be only three checks to execute, but we plan to add more.
But keep in mind that the Health Check is not designed as a magical fix-all-tool.
If you are encountering problems with a vault, make sure that the vault files are properly synchronized before running this tool.
That said, of course, we appreciate feedback about it regarding usability and functionality.</p><h3 id=plugin-api>Plugin API</h3><p>Cryptomator is now able to load plugins from a dedicated plugin directory.
In the long run, this allows integrating third party services, e.g. enter password via password manager.
The feature is still experimental and might change over time.
A first plugin is already available: A KeePassXC integration developed by PureJava. You can download it <a href=https://plugin.purejava.org>here</a>.</p><h2 id=update-guide>Update Guide</h2><p>In general, you should update, because you not only benefit from new features, but also from bug fixes.
Still, you might consider to delay the update, because Cryptomator 1.6.0 enforces the new format, i.e. old vaults need to be migrated in order to unlock them, and once a vault is migrated, older desktop versions won’t be able to open it.</p><p>Of course, and as always, Cryptomator provides a migration from older formats to version 8.
But to perform it, the app needs write access to the vault files (configuration files and encrypted data).
Details about the migration can be found in the vault format 8 article.
​
You should wait with the update, if</p><ul><li>you cannot update all Cryptomator apps (desktop and mobile)</li><li>you don&rsquo;t have write access to all the vaults you use.</li></ul><p>When you decide to update, there is one last issue you need to check beforehand:
If you ever manually altered the setting file <code>filenameLengthLimit</code> for a vault in the <code>settings.json</code> file, these modifications will be lost after the update and will be ignored if simply copied back.
A guide to migrate in this setting will be published soon.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Vault Format 8</h2><p>Hello Community!</p><p>We’d like to give you some information about an important part of the upcoming 1.6.0 release: The new vault format in version 8.</p><p>Yes, a new vault format. The ones who remember the last upgrade might start to groan, because last time the migration process from vault format 6 to 7 was in some cases not without hiccups.
But don&rsquo;t worry, this time the changes are significantly less invasive!</p><p>This article will give motivation for designing the new format, what the changes are in detail, and sketches how the migration process looks like, such that you know what you are up to.
​</p><h2 id=the-motivation>The Motivation</h2><p>The storage location of the masterkey is a topic, which in the early days of Cryptomator already raised a lot of questions and led to several feature requests. (e.g., look at the number of clicks in <a href=https://community.cryptomator.org/t/why-is-the-masterkey-stored-in-the-cloud/>https://community.cryptomator.org/t/why-is-the-masterkey-stored-in-the-cloud/</a>)</p><p>So, what is all the fuss about?
The masterkey of a vault is stored within the vault structure in a file called <code>masterkey.cryptomator</code> and encrypted with state-of-the-art algorithms.
Its location is not a security risk and, additionally, the location ensures that this integral part of a vault is always moved with the vault.
Admittedly, calling the file &ldquo;masterkey&rdquo; is an arguable decision, but it’s definitely obvious that the file is important.</p><p>But this isn&rsquo;t about the name.
By hardwiring where the masterkey is stored, we lose flexibility to load it from somewhere else. (A relating <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/96>feature request</a> is under the first 100 tickets of Cryptomator!)
What if a user has a hardware token which could store it?
Or what if a company has a centralized key management with <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on>single sign-on</a> and wants to use it with Cryptomator?
And even if workarounds for the above questions are found, how to deal with them when the vault structure/format changes?
​
These questions led to the idea of decoupling the masterkey retrieval from the vault structure and eventually into the design of vault format 8.
​</p><h2 id=the-changes>The Changes</h2><p>With vault format 8, we introduce a new file named <code>vault.cryptomator</code> for every vault located in the vault root.
This is the vault configuration file. Together with the data directory named <code>d</code>, they form the required minimum for a valid vault.</p><p>The vault config file is a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token>JWT</a> containing the basic information about the vault (like a unique identifier) and especially where to load the masterkey from.
All other parameters that are required to derive the masterkey are not stored in the vault config anymore, which decouples the key derivation from the vault format itself and opens the door to get the masterkey from other sources than just the <code>masterkey.cryptomator</code> file inside the vault.
For example, in future releases, you might be able to store the vault masterkey inside a <a href=https://www.yubico.com>Yubikey</a> or the Microsoft Certification Store.
Additionally, with the vault config being a JWT, it is signed by the masterkey itself and ensures that nobody tampered with it.</p><p>As noted above, the vault config file can also store additional information.
One is the vault-specific threshold of shortening <em>encrypted</em> filenames.
Before format 8, this value was set in stone in Cryptomator’s encryption scheme.
By specifying it in the vault config, it can be configurable in the future, such that the full capabilities of a vault are also available on more restrictive storage locations.</p><p>The encryption scheme, the directory structure, and encrypted files stay the same.
​</p><h2 id=the-migration>The Migration</h2><p>What do these changes mean for a migration from vault format 7 to 8? Nearly nothing!</p><p>The only file edited is <code>masterkey.cryptomator</code>.
Hence, for all &ldquo;online only&rdquo; users, it would be sufficient to only download this file.
For the migration process itself, first, the vault config file <code>vault.cryptomator</code> will be created and filled with the correct values like the aforementioned unique vault identifier and the filename shortening threshold.
Second, the already present masterkey file is updated.
And third… that&rsquo;s already it. &#x1f604; No other files need to be altered.
​</p><p>As you can see, vault format 8 only imposes a small and easy to migrate change, while making way for interesting and exciting new features.
With updating to Cryptomator 1.6.0, vaults of a former version need to be migrated and newly created ones will already be in format 8.
Keep in mind that the masterkey file is still needed, since it securely contains the actual key to your vault.​</p><p>We hope that your worries about a vault upgrade are reduced and you are eager to update!

We are well aware that the Document Provider is the most-requested feature of the Android app, but despite this fact, we need to temporarily shift our attention to other tasks within this project. This blog post you&rsquo;re reading right now is to keep you, our community, updated and inform you that we are unable to stick to our original plan. Unfortunately, this means that any further development of the Document Provider feature needs to be postponed to the end of this year.</p><h2 id=the-document-provider-feature>The Document Provider Feature</h2><p>As users of our Android app, you know how cumbersome sometimes the work with it is: You open your favourite notes app to quickly jot something down, then notice that you cannot open your to-do list from the app because you store it encrypted with Cryptomator. So you sigh, open the Cryptomator app, unlock your vault, navigate to the to-do list file and open it with the aforementioned notes app. Definitely not the optimal workflow.</p><p>We always strive to provide the same features across all our supported platforms. One of these is a user-friendly integration of the vault into the running OS to easily access content of unlocked vaults. For the desktop systems, this feature was always present and recently we added it in our new iOS app. The last OS, where it is missing is Android. And the way to resolve this, is implementing a Document Provider for our Android app.</p><p>The Document Provider feature creates a virtual access point to an unlocked vault, with the consequence that you can conveniently browse and access a vault’s content via the standard file browser. Also, any app which supports browsing through Document Providers can directly load files from your unlocked vault without the need to go via Cryptomator’s app GUI.</p><h2 id=development-status>Development Status</h2><p>The development is tracked in the following ticket of our issue tracker: <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/android/issues/35>https://github.com/cryptomator/android/issues/35</a></p><p>As you can see, the issue is already quite old and got over the time a countable amount of comments. After <a href=https://cryptomator.org/blog/2020/12/23/android-open-source/>publishing the source code</a> of the app at the end of 2020, our plan was to work on this important feature.</p><p>From the technical side, we already determined the parts of code needed to be edited, developed a concept and built a proof of concept (see the linked ticket). The next step would be to actually implement it including rigorous testing.</p><p>Unfortunately, we determined that integrating Document Provider into the existing app would require major architectural changes, therefore requiring a lot of time and resources. We have exciting plans with Cryptomator after our next major release with version 1.6.0 so that we have to delay the development of the Document Provider integration to the end of 2021.</p><p>Meanwhile, maybe you, our community can help us out.</p><h2 id=call-for-contributions>Call for Contributions</h2><p>Cryptomator for Desktop was always open source. Cryptomator for iOS and Android are now open source as well. And as such, we also rely on our community to receive feedback, distribute the app and improve its functionality.</p><p>So, we are always very excited about contributions and are happy to assist, especially when it comes to the Document Provider. &#x1f609;</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator 2.0 for iOS: Open Source and Beta Release</h2><p>Finally, the time has come! &#x1f389; The brand new iOS app of Cryptomator can now be tried out in a beta version via TestFlight and the project is now, as previously announced, fully open-source!

On iPad, drag & drop is possible with the new app. In general, all features of the Files app are automatically supported by Cryptomator.</p><p>Development on the new iOS app started just over a year ago and was rewritten from scratch in the Swift programming language. We are now using the latest tools to develop the app and can therefore support new features of iOS faster. This makes the project more future-proof and easier to maintain. Half a year ago, we were able to open-source the Android app and have released numerous updates with great contributions from the community since then. We couldn&rsquo;t wait to release the source code of the new iOS app as well.

Read more about it in this roadmap!</p><h2 id=state-of-the-desktop-app>State of the Desktop App</h2><p>The update to version 1.6.0 is just around the corner! The release will mainly contain some invisible changes that will allow us to add new features in a timely manner. One of the main points here is to implement a new vault format (Vault Format 8). It makes the integration of <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/projects/8>other authentication methods</a> in the future possible, for example to enable 2FA.</p><p>Another feature is the <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/projects/7>integration of a sanitizer</a>. Until now, a separate program was needed to check the state of your vault and to execute cleanup and restore commands. In the future, this will be possible directly in the Cryptomator user interface.</p><p>In addition, there is now a prototype for the distribution of Cryptomator as a Microsoft Software Installation (.msi), but the implementation still has alpha character. Furthermore, we have updated Cryptomator to JDK 16 with the latest <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.5.14>version 1.5.14</a>, which brings some upstream fixes. Unfortunately, we could not make any progress with regard to Flatpak.</p><h2 id=state-of-the-android-app>State of the Android App</h2><p>As you might have noticed in our blog, we finally published the source code of the app! Apart from that, vault format 8 is also a big topic in our development here.</p><p>Since the update to version 1.5.14 (currently still in a beta version), pCloud is natively supported by Cryptomator. Many thanks to Manu for <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/android/pull/283>his open source contribution</a>! Another small change is that since the update 1.5.13, it is possible to sort the vault list and thus get a better overview of the vaults.</p><p>But that&rsquo;s not all we have planned for the Android app! We are happy to release Cryptomator on F-Droid soon. Also, we hope to be able to include more clouds soon and enable access to content of the vault via third-party apps with a &ldquo;document provider&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=state-of-the-ios-app>State of the iOS App</h2><p>With the introduction of vault format 8, the &ldquo;old&rdquo; iOS app will probably get its last major update to version 1.6.0.</p><p>Meanwhile, work on the &ldquo;new&rdquo; iOS app continues. As announced in the last roadmap, the iOS app will be fully integrated into the Files app. We are already very far along. Nevertheless, we still have some work to do, as we want to offer some features like dark mode or support for multiple accounts from the same cloud provider right from the start.</p><p>We can&rsquo;t promise you an exact release date yet, but we hope we will release a first beta version via TestFlight in the summer.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Open Source: Cryptomator for Android</h2><p>We announced it last month and now we are ready… our gift to the community for the holidays: Cryptomator for Android is now fully open-source!

Well, actually the changes were in 1.5.9 but we followed it up with a hotfix release. &#x1f601; With the (crazy) year nearing its end, we&rsquo;d like to give you some insight to our roadmap across all platforms for the upcoming months!</p><h2 id=state-of-the-desktop-app>State of the Desktop App</h2><p>With the redesign and full rewrite of the UI in 1.5.0, we established a good foundation for adding further features. There was one former feature that didn&rsquo;t make the cut though, which is now back with the latest version: Vault Statistics. &#x1f389;</p><figure class=text-center><img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src=/img/blog/vault-statistics.png srcset="/img/blog/vault-statistics.png 1x, /img/blog/vault-statistics@2x.png 2x" alt="Vault Statistics in Cryptomator"></figure><p>We didn&rsquo;t stop there! Vault passwords can now also be stored in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KWallet>KWallet</a> on Linux. Huge thanks to Ralph Plawetzki (purejava on GitHub) for his contribution! And last but not least, it is now possible to mount the vault via FUSE on Windows. This is still a beta feature! In order to try it, <a href=http://www.secfs.net/winfsp/>WinFSP</a> needs to be installed. We&rsquo;d love to hear your feedback on this!</p><p>On the distribution front, we didn&rsquo;t quite meet our expectations. So far, we&rsquo;ve been struggling with Flatpak as we just can&rsquo;t convince its sandbox to properly support FUSE drives. But we&rsquo;re not giving up on this!</p><p>Behind the UI, we introduced the <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/integrations-api>integrations-api</a> alongside implementations for each OS. It&rsquo;s a new way for Cryptomator to include native (also OS-specific) functionalities. Now easier than ever, you can implement native functions. So grab your keyboard and start hacking! &#x1f601; With this change, we archived the old <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/native-functions>native-functions</a> repository. &#x1f44b;</p><p>What&rsquo;s next? Our plan is to move on to 1.6.x. First of all, we want to integrate <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/sanitizer>Sanitizer</a>, so you can check your vault health and run cleanup and recovery tasks right within the Cryptomator UI. Furthermore, by decoupling the key derivation from the vault encryption, we plan to give you more options for authentication, including third-party password storage, 2FA, and multi-user access using individual passwords.</p><h2 id=state-of-the-android-app>State of the Android App</h2><p>In the last months, we added new features like <a href=https://community.cryptomator.org/t/biometric-authentication-e-g-face-unlock-coming-soon/6089>face unlock</a>, <a href=https://community.cryptomator.org/t/sort-directory-listings/5958>sort directory listings</a>, and <a href=https://community.cryptomator.org/t/search-in-current-folder-using-glob-pattern-matching/5928>search using glob pattern matching</a>. Some community members also translated the app to <a href=https://community.cryptomator.org/t/translated-into-french/5962>French</a> and <a href=https://community.cryptomator.org/t/cryptomator-is-soon-available-in-turkish/6560>Turkish</a>. Many thanks for their contributions!</p><p>Looking forward, we have some exciting news about our Android app! The project is in the perfect situation to fulfill the two biggest wishes of the community:</p><ol><li>Open Source: Publishing the source code of the app.</li><li>Document Provider: Accessing the content of the vault using third-party apps.</li></ol><p>You heard that right, we are going to open-source Cryptomator for Android! The fact that the app is open-core had its legitimate reasons but we are now fully confident that we can open-source the app without compromises. We are working hard to publish the complete source code within a few weeks.</p><p>After that, the highly anticipated Document Provider feature will be on our roadmap.</p><h2 id=state-of-the-ios-app>State of the iOS App</h2><p>What&rsquo;s up with Cryptomator for iOS? For the last 6-7 months, we have been hard at work on a <em>completely</em> new app written in Swift. Our first efforts can already be seen in our new open-source libraries for Swift: <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptolib-swift>cryptolib-swift</a> and <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cloud-access-swift>cloud-access-swift</a>.</p><p>What will be so special about the rewrite? Cryptomator will be fully integrated into the Files app. This comes with many benefits like thumbnails, support for third-party apps that can edit files directly inside the vault, and many more! But that also means, there won&rsquo;t be a &ldquo;custom&rdquo; file browser inside the app anymore. Integration into the Files app is one of the most requested features of the community.</p><p>What about open source? We won&rsquo;t open-source the current app anymore because we&rsquo;d like to look forward. The new app is written with open-sourcing it in mind but it will still take some time until we can release anything.</p><p>We&rsquo;ll definitely do extensive testing via TestFlight in the next year. Stay tuned for that!</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator for Android for Us Paranoids</h2><p>This blog post is aimed towards the paranoid Cryptomator power users among us and describes how to fully establish a relationship of trust with Cryptomator for Android.</p><p>When it comes to our desktop application, we claim that you should in fact <em>not</em> trust us but you (or at least many developers) can instead <em>inspect</em> what Cryptomator is doing. For our mobile apps, this is only half the truth, frankly. While the encryption code is fully open-source, the UI and cloud access code isn&rsquo;t (yet &#x1f609;).<br>If you count yourself as one of the more paranoid users, who prefer to compile everything yourselves, you might ask the legitimate question: How can you check the current, open-core app for backdoors?</p><p>A backdoor usually requires communication with an external server. If vaults are only opened from the device&rsquo;s file system, the Cryptomator app does not require an internet connection. Alternatively, the vault can be synchronized bidirectionally to the file system of the smartphone with a third-party application such as <a class=text-link href=https://syncthing.net/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Syncthing</a>.</p><p>Using this setup, the Cryptomator app can have its internet access revoked using the Android operating system features, which prevents the app from sending or receiving any data to or from the internet.</p><figure class=text-center><img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src=/img/blog/android-for-paranoids-permission.png alt="Android revoke Cryptomator's internet permission"></figure><p>Thus, even if there ever was a backdoor in Cryptomator for Android, it would not be possible for the intercepted data to leave the smartphone. This is ensured by the operating system.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator 1.5.0 Release</h2><figure class=text-center><img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src=/img/blog/cryptomator-1-5-0.png srcset="/img/blog/cryptomator-1-5-0.png 1x, /img/blog/cryptomator-1-5-0@2x.png 2x" alt="Cryptomator 1.5.0 is now available with a brand-new user interface (incl. dark mode) and an improved vault format"></figure><p>Cryptomator has been redesigned and comes with a new dark mode. It is not simply a redesign, it was a full rewrite of the UI. During the rewrite, a whole new code structure was planned which makes it easier to extend the application in the future. One goal of the redesign was to make the onboarding process easier for users who don&rsquo;t feel too comfortable with encryption software. Usability tests helped designing the workflows and understanding common misconceptions. Besides the redesign, the new vault format 7 increases compatibility with some cloud services and at the same time reduces the complexity for certain I/O operations.</p><p>To support the ongoing open-source development of Cryptomator, consider <a href=/donate/>buying a donation key</a>, which unlocks the new dark mode. &#x2764;&#xfe0f; <a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.5.0 target=_blank rel=noopener>Detailed release notes</a> for the desktop app are available on GitHub.</p><p>As you might have noticed, this website is also shining in a completely new design. &#x2728;</p><h2 id=cryptomator-for-ios--android>Cryptomator for iOS & Android</h2><p>New updates for iOS and Android have been released as well. To celebrate the release, our mobile apps are 40% off until April 23! &#x1f916;</p><p>Cryptomator for Android is now also available as an APK version <a href=/android/>through our own online store</a>.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator Roadmap Early 2020</h2><p>Between all the work on Cryptomator, we need to remind ourselves to not forget about our regular updates post. While most of you have already noticed that we&rsquo;re approaching a new major release of Cryptomator, I think it is time to inform you where we&rsquo;re currently standing and what our roadmap looks like.</p><h2 id=state-of-our-desktop-application>State of our Desktop Application</h2><p>We plan to release 1.5.0 within Q1 2020. In our currently running beta (huge shout-outs to all the helpful test feedback), we have already sorted out several problems and feel confident to deliver outstanding quality.</p><p>While we have already discussed <a href="https://community.cryptomator.org/t/handling-of-long-filenames-in-cryptomator-1-5-0/4191?u=overheadhunter">upcoming changes</a> to what we call the <em>vault format</em> (i.e. the layout of the encrypted files and directory) to increase compatibility with some cloud services and at the same time reduce the complexity for certain I/O operations, the far more obvious change affects the GUI:</p><p>We did not simply <em>redesign</em> our UI, we did a full <em>rewrite</em> of it. Nearly every single line of code that was involved in Cryptomator 1.4.x has been deleted. Why would you do something like this? Well, the application grew over time. Cryptomator has been started more than six years ago and some concepts weren&rsquo;t established back then that make development easier today. During the rewrite, we planned a whole new code structure which makes it easier to extend the application in the future and at the same time have new developers understand what parts of the code is responsible for what dialog in the software.</p><p>One goal of the redesign was to make the onboarding process easier for users who don&rsquo;t feel too comfortable with encryption software. We attended (and organized) some usability tests in our vicinity and saw how first-time users reacted to the vault creation process. This helped us to design the workflows and understand common misconceptions.</p><h2 id=state-of-the-android-app>State of the Android App</h2><p>Not worth mentioning is that the Android app in 1.5.0 will support vault format 7. In the Android app, we focused on implementing new features and improving stability:</p><ul><li>Already opened files are cached on the smartphone. When reopened and if the file has not changed in the cloud, the file is loaded from the local file system, which leads to a huge performance improvement.</li><li>Fixed and improved auto photo upload e.g., after device reboot or on Android 10 under certain conditions the upload didn’t work</li><li>We added an option to lock a vault immediately when Cryptomator is closed or in background</li><li>Last but not least, we&rsquo;ve put a lot of work into a new license store that will enable us to provide an alternative way of distributing our Android app, as we have a lot of requests from users who prefer not to use Google services such as the Play Store</li></ul><h2 id=state-of-the-ios-app>State of the iOS App</h2><p>The iOS app will also support vault format 7, obviously. There are some further fixes and improvements under the hood, but no new features. It already supports caching and it you can even buy it without using the Google Play Store. &#x1f609;</p><h2 id=what-is-missing-for-the-final-release-of-150>What is missing for the final release of 1.5.0?</h2><p>While at the time of writing this, there are only few missing features planned for 1.5.0 (such as vault recovery) and only some final polishing is required from our side, we want to make sure our mobile apps and also third party apps such as Cyberduck are ready to deal with the new vault format, too. For some bugs scheduled for 1.5.0 (such as <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/986>this one</a>), we&rsquo;re currently waiting for an upstream fix.</p><p>Simultaneously, we&rsquo;re preparing new documentation pages for 1.5.0 as well as a new website with a new FAQ section and we integrate <a href="https://community.cryptomator.org/t/localization-of-cryptomator-1-5-0/4269?u=overheadhunter">new translations</a> added by our great community on a regular basis.</p><h2 id=whats-up-next>What&rsquo;s up next?</h2><p>Our first priority right after 1.5.0 is to migrate from Java 11 to Java 14. Java 14 includes a long-awaited new tool that is required for our packaging. We&rsquo;re currently using a workaround that prevents us from upgrading to the latest bundled JRE. This is a small change that will probably be shipped right with 1.5.1. However, we didn&rsquo;t want to dig up new holes right before 1.5.0 and decided to postpone this to 1.5.1.</p><p>Next, we want to focus on Flatpak. We ditched <code>.deb</code> and <code>.rpm</code> files some time ago and replaced them with AppImages. We also really like how the Flatpak ecosystem is gaining traction and is supported natively by a steadily increasing number of distributions. So far, <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/729>we didn&rsquo;t get Cryptomator working</a> due to the complexity behind the file system mounts. But after we&rsquo;ve finished 1.5.0, we hope to be able to put some more attention to this and solve this to ship Cryptomator as a Flatpak soon.</p><p>In the Android app, the next big feature will be accessing files of a Cryptomator vault inside other apps using a DocumentProvider. For example, a file explorer will be able to access the content of the vault in this way. As well as smaller features like recursive upload of folders to the vault are planned.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator Roadmap Mid 2019</h2><p>We would like to take a more regular look at our roadmap to publicly document the past, present, and future developments of Cryptomator. Unlike before, we&rsquo;re also going to have a look at the roadmaps of our mobile apps.</p><h2 id=desktop>Desktop</h2><p>In the desktop area, we are currently pursuing two different branches: On the one hand we are striving for feature completion of 1.4.x, with 1.4.12 already available as a release candidate. It will finally allow Linux users to store their password in the system and include the much desired &ldquo;Custom Mount Flags&rdquo; feature.</p><ul><li><strong>Save password in system (Linux):</strong> For a long time, you could only store your vault&rsquo;s password in the system under macOS and Windows. Through a community contribution, this is now finally also possible under (some) Linux systems. &#x1f604; The existence of GNOME Keyring or another keychain via Secret Service API is required. Many thanks to Ralph Plawetzki (purejava on GitHub) and Sebastian Wiesendahl (swiesend on GitHub) for the implementation!</li><li><strong>Custom Mount Flags:</strong> Cryptomator uses default options to mount a drive (both for Dokany and FUSE) that we chose for security or performance reasons. However, this leads to limited functionality in some cases and users who want to set their own options can now change them. Be aware: <em>Use at your own risk!</em></li></ul><p>On the other hand the implementation of 1.5.0 has already started. For 1.5.0, as announced, we want to fully concentrate on the redesign of the user interface and improve the internal processing of Cryptomator, because like many open-source projects it has grown organically over time and therefore needs a good refactoring. &#x1f609;</p><h2 id=ios>iOS</h2><p>After the release of Cryptomator 1.4.0 for iOS with built-in cache functionality, which on the one hand avoids repeated downloading of files and on the other hand allows (limited) offline access, the work on Cryptomator 1.5.0 for iOS has started.</p><p>The main focus will be the integration into the Files app of iOS. The first step will be the expansion of our <a class=text-link href=https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/FileProvider.html target=_blank rel=noopener>Document Provider</a> which is going to be extended by the methods &ldquo;Open&rdquo; and &ldquo;Move&rdquo;. This will make a direct access to files within a Cryptomator vault from other apps possible without having to copy them back and forth.</p><h2 id=android>Android</h2><p>Cryptomator 1.4.0 for Android is currently being finalized with the following features, which can already be tested in a beta version:</p><ul><li><strong>Automatic photo upload:</strong> After activation, all images created on the smartphone will be uploaded the next time the selected vault is unlocked.</li><li><strong>Make files writable by third-party apps:</strong> Files that are opened can be edited in third-party apps. When you finish the editing process by saving and returning to the Cryptomator app, the changes are transferred to the cloud.</li></ul><p>We are considering these features for future versions:</p><ul><li><strong>LRU Cache:</strong> To save network traffic, certain server responses are cached to avoid repeated downloading, for example of unmodified images from the cloud.</li><li><strong>Support for Google Team Drives:</strong> Access to vaults located in Google Team Drive should be made possible.</li><li><strong>Distribution of the app outside of Google Play:</strong> Cryptomator for Android should also be available from alternative sources. We are thinking about setting up a licensing system, through which a license could be purchased directly.</li><li><strong>Unlocking with system password:</strong> You should be able to use the system password of the smartphone to open vaults. (Similar to unlocking with a fingerprint.)</li><li><strong>Access to files via DocumentProvider:</strong> Access to a Cryptomator vault inside other apps should be made possible via a DocumentProvider. For example, a file explorer would then be able to access the vault in this way.</li><li><strong>Upload of directories (recursive):</strong> The download of whole folders already works, the upload including all subfolders is not possible yet.</li></ul></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator Roadmap Early 2019</h2><p>Hey it&rsquo;s a new year, so here comes our <del>quarterly</del> annual &#x1f648; roadmap preview.</p><h3 id=openjdk-and-openjfx>OpenJDK and OpenJFX</h3><p>Until now we&rsquo;ve been using Oracle JDK, since this included the GUI library we used for Cryptomator: JavaFX. Beginning with JDK 11, we plan to switch to OpenJDK and OpenJFX. JavaFX will no longer be included in the Oracle JDK anyway and OpenJFX promises shorter release cycles and - as the name suggests - is developed in an open process.</p><p>Since we no longer depend on non-free software, Cryptomator could theoretically move from &ldquo;contrib&rdquo; to &ldquo;main&rdquo; in Debian repos.</p><p>We also hope that building Cryptomator becomes easier, since OpenJFX is a normal dependency and you no longer need to install the Oracle JDK.</p><h3 id=symlinks>Symlinks</h3><p>We have successfully moved to FUSE (Linux and macOS) and Dokany (Windows). Now it is time to improve the file systems. One of the most asked features is support for symbolic links. If you don&rsquo;t know what this is, don&rsquo;t worry. For everyone else: Stay tuned for a 1.4.x update introducing symlinks.</p><h3 id=ui-redesign>UI Redesign</h3><p>We plan to redesign the whole user interface from scratch with Cryptomator 1.5.0.

This will be <em>additional</em> to WebDAV and will become the new default setting. We are currently developing the <a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/fuse-nio-adapter target=_blank rel=noopener>necessary library</a>. It is based on <a class=text-link href=https://github.com/SerCeMan/jnr-fuse target=_blank rel=noopener>jnr-fuse</a>, which means you need <em>FUSE for macOS</em> or <em>WinFsp</em> in case of Windows. The Linux kernel supports FUSE out of the box.</p><p>A big challenge at the moment is how to include <em>WinFsp</em> or <em>FUSE for macOS</em> in the installer. First test versions will therefore require manual installation of named libraries.</p><p>The benefit of using FUSE lies not only in performance enhancements (which are already clearly measurable in the current state of development for some file/directory operations) but also in the expected increase in compatibility with third-party software. There are several problems related to the WebDAV drive, as can be seen in <a class=text-link href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Amisc%3Awebdav" target=_blank rel=noopener>our issues list</a>.</p><h3 id=java-9>Java 9</h3><p>During the Christmas holidays, I made all libraries and the desktop application compatible with Java 9. Our <a class=text-link href=https://travis-ci.org/cryptomator/ target=_blank rel=noopener>CI builds</a> now run uniformly with JDK 9 in containers. However, the code is still compiled for older Java versions, not just because our Android app depends on it.</p><p>What&rsquo;s the point? Java 9 is a huge step in the development of the Java platform. In addition to various bug fixes that directly benefit Cryptomator users, e.g. better support for HiDPI displays under Windows and Linux, there were massive refactorings which form the basis for a new release model of the Java platform with new <a class=text-link href=https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/faster-and-easier-use-and-redistribution-of-java-se target=_blank rel=noopener>feature releases in six-month cycles</a>. This means that we will be able to benefit from new features in the future more rapidly without having to rely on unstable test versions.</p><p>However, the conversion to Java 9 with Cryptomator 1.4.0 is also the basis for the use of the Java Platform Module System from Cryptomator 1.5.0 onwards, whereby <a class=text-link href=http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/275 target=_blank rel=noopener>much smaller applications</a> can be built. In a first test, the size of the Cryptomator application for macOS was reduced from over 200 MiB (in the installed state) to about 70 MiB.</p><h3 id=intellij>IntelliJ</h3><p>We switched our build platform from Eclipse to IntelliJ because the JDK 9 compatible versions of Eclipse contain changes to the compiler that didn&rsquo;t get along with code generated by <a class=text-link href=https://github.com/google/dagger/issues/949 target=_blank rel=noopener>Dagger</a>.</p><p>Furthermore, our Android developers are already used to IntelliJ so that we can harmonize our tools a little bit here.</p><h3 id=64-bit>64 Bit</h3><p>Since both WinFsp and JDK 9 require 64 bit, Cryptomator will no longer support 32 bit systems as of version 1.4.0. Although this is a pity, it also speeds up the development process because fewer systems have to be tested.</p><p>Cryptomator 1.3.x will be 100% compatible with 1.4.0. This means that users who depend on 32-bit software can continue to use Cryptomator vaults.</p><hr><p>Did you find this insight interesting?

We tried hosting the virtual drive via <code>localhost</code>, <code>127.0.0.1</code>, and <code>::1</code> but every host has its own issue: Sometimes access to the virtual drive was extremely slow, sometimes Windows showed unnecessary security warnings (<a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/529 target=_blank rel=noopener>#529</a>), and sometimes Office didn&rsquo;t properly work (<a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/512 target=_blank rel=noopener>#512</a>). That&rsquo;s why the Windows installer for Cryptomator now writes the new host <code>cryptomator-vault</code> (which is mapped to <code>127.0.0.1</code>) into the <code>hosts</code> file. Weirdly enough, with that new host, all problems seem to be gone.

Well, it&rsquo;s not that mysterious anymore, but this particular error had been haunting us from the beginning! Cycor on GitHub (almost casually) pointed out in <a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/210#issuecomment-262034669 target=_blank rel=noopener>GitHub Issue 210</a> that he found the cause of system error 53/67 after a few months of experiencing the issue himself.</p><p>Apparently, there is a Windows Registry entry responsible for listing available network providers called <a class=text-link href=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc959369.aspx target=_blank rel=noopener>ProviderOrder</a>. Cryptomator&rsquo;s virtual drive is based on WebDAV. Therefore, a missing <code>webclient</code> value in the <code>ProviderOrder</code> registry key would lead to such error. We were stunned, desperate, and hopeless for many months, because we were never able to reproduce the issue. We added things like the IPv6 literal option (which is probably going to be removed in a future version) or thought that some firewall was responsible for the error. But nope! Clearly some applications modify this registry entry, because a clean Windows installation doesn&rsquo;t have the <code>webclient</code> value missing. Shame on them! &#x1f514;</p><p>We fixed this issue by patching the Cryptomator for Windows installer and added some code that adds the <code>webclient</code> value back to the <code>ProviderOrder</code> key, if it is missing. The registry key can be found at <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\NetworkProvider\Order</code>. If you&rsquo;re a fellow developer and stumbled on this blog post while having the same issue and even using Inno Setup yourself, you can <a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-win/blob/master/package/windows/Cryptomator.iss target=_blank rel=noopener>find the code on GitHub</a>.</p><p>Big thanks to Cycor for finding the solution to this weird bug! &#x1f604;</p><p>Furthermore, version 1.2.3 (also available for Mac and Linux) includes other improvements:</p><ul><li>Saved password can now be forgotten by deselecting the checkbox.

Stay tuned!</li><li>We plan to improve the desktop app compatibility- and performance-wise by integrating <a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/252 target=_blank rel=noopener>FUSE</a>/<a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/207 target=_blank rel=noopener>Dokany</a> (<a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/315 target=_blank rel=noopener>PFM has been suggested</a> instead of Dokany, we&rsquo;re still evaluating this). Hopefully, we can launch a first beta with these major changes by the end of this year.</li><li>Due to these major development efforts we have been modularizing the cryptographic relevant libraries into <a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptolib target=_blank rel=noopener>cryptolib</a> and <a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptofs target=_blank rel=noopener>cryptofs</a> under the GPL license. In that way, it&rsquo;s easier for us to use the same libraries across multiple apps and also for third parties to use them independent of our main application. These libraries aren&rsquo;t final yet.</li><li>We haven&rsquo;t planned our 1.2 milestone yet, but the <a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/40 target=_blank rel=noopener></a> has been highly requested and is probably the biggest contender right now. We hear you and we&rsquo;d like to thank you for all your feedback! &#x1f604;</li></ul></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>In-Depth: Export Compliance for French iOS App Store</h2><p>Cyptomator for iOS has finally been approved by the French administration. You can download it now in the <a class=text-link href=https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/cryptomator/id953086535 target=_blank rel=noopener>French App Store</a>. We&rsquo;d like to share our experience on how to receive export compliance for the French iOS App Store.</p><p>Just to be clear, you also need the U.S. Encryption Registration (ERN) approval from the U.S. Bureau of Industry (BIS). But this has already been covered by many sites, just google for <code>export compliance ern ios app store</code>.</p><p>However, there is little information on how to get the French encryption declaration approval from the Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d&rsquo;information (ANSSI). This information could be useful for fellow developers that are e.g. using third-party libraries for cryptographic operations in their iOS app. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is also needed for the Google Play Store (or other Android app stores). We&rsquo;ll see soon enough.</p><h3 id=when-do-you-need-french-approval>When do you need French approval?</h3><p>Let&rsquo;s take a look on how we&rsquo;ve filled out our export compliance documentation in iTunes Connect, which is needed for apps containing encryption.</p><table class=table-auto><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">ID</th><th class="px-4 py-2">Question</th><th class="px-4 py-2">Answer</th></tr><tr class=border-t><td class="px-4 py-2">1</td><td class="px-4 py-2">Is your app designed to use cryptography or does it contain or incorporate cryptography? (Select Yes even if your app is only utilizing the encryption available in iOS or OS X.)</td><td class="px-4 py-2">Yes</td></tr><tr class=border-t><td class="px-4 py-2">2</td><td class="px-4 py-2">Does your app qualify for any of the exemptions provided in Category 5, Part 2 of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations?</td><td class="px-4 py-2">No</td></tr><tr class=border-t><td class="px-4 py-2">3</td><td class="px-4 py-2">Does your app implement one or more encryption algorithms that are proprietary or yet to be accepted as standard by international standard bodies (such as, the IEEE, IETF, ITU, and so on)?</td><td class="px-4 py-2">No</td></tr><tr class=border-t><td class="px-4 py-2">4</td><td class="px-4 py-2">Does your app implement one or more encryption algorithms instead of, or in addition to, accessing or using the encryption in iOS and OS X?</td><td class="px-4 py-2">Yes</td></tr><tr class=border-t><td class="px-4 py-2">5</td><td class="px-4 py-2">Is your app going to be available on the French App Store?</td><td class="px-4 py-2">Yes</td></tr></table><p>Our answer to question 4 is probably less common among typical apps using encryption. Additionally to Apple&rsquo;s CommonCrypto, we&rsquo;re making use of OpenSSL and scrypt, which aren&rsquo;t bundled with the standard library of iOS. Only then you&rsquo;re going to be asked question 5 and only then you have to submit a copy of the French encryption declaration approval from the ANSSI.</p><h3 id=how-do-i-submit-an-application-to-the-anssi>How do I submit an application to the ANSSI?</h3><p>Thought you&rsquo;d never ask. Thankfully, there is an English website for this: <a class=text-link href=http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/regulation/cryptology/how-to-submit-an-application/ target=_blank rel=noopener>http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/regulation/cryptology/how-to-submit-an-application/</a></p><p>But the fun stops there. From now on, everything is in French. Yup. That&rsquo;s right. Everything. Even the responses you receive are in French. And you have to submit your request via mail (yes, not email).</p><p>What&rsquo;s our advice on this? Best case you know someone who can read/write French, but in our case we just used Google Translate extensively. We&rsquo;ve filled out the approval form in English, because we hoped for common sense that they&rsquo;re at least able to read our request in English. And it worked!</p><h3 id=how-long-does-it-take-until-my-request-has-been-processedapproved>How long does it take until my request has been processed/approved?</h3><p>The official statement is:</p><blockquote><p>Declaration requests are processed within one month from receipt of the complete request file and authorisation requests within four months from the same date.</p></blockquote><p>We&rsquo;ve submitted our declaration request in the beginning of April 2016 and received a first response in the beginning of May. It was just to inform us that they&rsquo;ve received our request and it&rsquo;ll take another two months to finish the process. In the end, we&rsquo;ve received the approval two months after our submission.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t remember exactly how long it took to get the ERN approval, but it was just a matter of days and completely processed online.</p><h3 id=summary>Summary</h3><p>I hope you learned something from our experience and if you&rsquo;re an app developer struggling with the same issue, you hopefully received some insight in this process. Obviously, this information may change in the future, so do some additional research. &#x1f609;</p><p>Funny story: In the approval form are checkboxes, which you can enable if you&rsquo;re sending a CD or USB flash drive with information of your product (like commercial brochure, user manual, technical details). I couldn&rsquo;t believe what they were asking for, so I didn&rsquo;t send anything besides the approval form. They kindly sent me an email, if I could provide a commercial or technical brochure for Cryptomator so that they can process my request. So I did that via email and everything was fine. &#x1f604;</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator 1.1 Release</h2><p>Cryptomator 1.1 for Windows, OS X, and Linux is out now!
