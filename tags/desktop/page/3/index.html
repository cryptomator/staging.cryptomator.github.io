Along with useful new features and important bug fixes, this release also comes with a special call to our community.</p><h2 id=new-features--fixes>New Features & Fixes</h2><p>With Cryptomator Desktop 1.18.0, we’re once again bringing improvements and bug fixes across all platforms:</p><h4 id=new-feature>New Feature</h4><ul><li>Remember Last Vault Location<br>When creating a new vault, Cryptomator will now automatically suggest the last chosen storage location. This makes setup more convenient, especially if you manage multiple vaults in similar folder structures.</li></ul><h4 id=fixes>Fixes</h4><ul><li>Linux/KDE: QuickAccess Entries<br>On KDE, each unlock process created a new QuickAccess entry in the Dolphin file manager, even if one already existed (e.g., after an unexpected app crash). This is now fixed – existing entries are reused, and no manual cleanup is needed.</li><li>Prevention of Huge Log Files<br>On Windows, log files could in rare cases grow extremely large, causing system issues. The existing size limit of log files was bypassed in those cases. This has been fixed, so the app can safely run in the background without issues.</li><li>macOS: Stability When Saving Vault Passwords<br>Some users experienced app crashes when trying to save a vault password. This bug has now been fixed, so password saving on macOS works reliably.</li><li>macOS: macFUSE Detection on macOS 26<br>In the upcoming macOS version 26, macFUSE was sometimes not detected, leading to problems when mounting vaults. This issue is fixed to ensure Cryptomator works smoothly on the latest macOS releases.</li></ul><div class=text-center><a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.18.0-beta1/><i class="fa-solid fa-download"></i> Download the Beta 1.18.0 here</a></div><h2 id=we-need-your-support>We Need Your Support!</h2><p>In addition to these updates, there’s something special this time:<br>Our Windows installer is now signed with a new certificate. Since this certificate is not yet widely recognized in Microsoft’s trust network, Windows may display a security prompt when installing the beta version.</p><p>The more people install the beta, the faster the certificate will gain trust – and the security dialog will disappear. Don’t worry: the installer is still safe and signed by us. Windows just needs to “learn” that the new certificate is trustworthy.</p><h2 id=final-words>Final Words</h2><p>With version 1.18.0, we’re making Cryptomator more convenient, stable, and future-proof. The beta is an important step – not only to test the new features and fixes, but also to establish our new certificate in the Windows ecosystem.</p><p>We’re grateful for every bit of support from the community:</p><ul><li>Install the beta and try out the updates.</li><li>Share your feedback if you notice anything.</li><li>Help us make the final release as stable and user-friendly as possible.</li></ul><p>Your feedback makes Cryptomator stronger – and ensures we can all keep our data securely encrypted.</p><p>Thank you for your support – we can’t wait for the final release of 1.18.0! 🎉</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator 1.17.0: Windows, say "Hello"!</h2><p>With the new update to version <strong>1.17.0</strong>, Cryptomator becomes even better — more stable, more compatible, and more user-friendly. In this blog post, we’ll take a look at the most exciting new features and explain why this upgrade is worth it.</p><figure class=text-center><a href=/downloads/ target=_blank rel=noopener><img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src=/img/blog/desktop-1.17.0.png alt="Cryptomator Release 1.17.0"></a></figure><h2 id=whats-new>What’s New?</h2><p><strong>Windows Hello Integration</strong></p><p>Starting now, you can unlock your vaults on Windows using <strong>Windows Hello</strong> — whether via facial recognition, fingerprint, or PIN. Added security meets maximum convenience. Once again, big thanks to <a href=https://github.com/purejava>Ralph (purejava on GitHub)</a> for contributing to this feature!</p><p><strong>Double-Click to Unlock Vaults</strong></p><p>You can now unlock your vaults by simply <strong>double-clicking the</strong> <code>vault.cryptomator</code> <strong>file</strong> — no need to open the app interface first. This makes accessing frequently used vaults even easier.</p><p><strong>Updated Graphical Framework: JavaFX 24</strong></p><p>Under the hood, Cryptomator&rsquo;s graphical foundation has been updated to <strong>JavaFX 24</strong>. This not only brings greater stability but also improves compatibility with modern systems.</p><h2 id=whats-fixed>What’s Fixed?</h2><p><strong>WinFsp Update: Blue Screen on Windows Resolved</strong></p><p>One of the most important updates concerns the <strong>WinFsp driver</strong>, which Cryptomator uses to mount vaults. The update to the latest version fixes a critical bug that, in combination with certain Trend Micro security products, could cause a blue screen.</p><p><strong>Legacy Vaults Can Be Imported Again</strong></p><p>A pesky bug has been squashed: <strong>Importing legacy vaults now works smoothly again</strong>. So if you have older backups, you can now restore them without any issues in this version.</p><p>You can find all the other changes in the <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.17.0>changelog on GitHub</a>!</p><h3 id=and-what-about-windows-arm>And what about Windows ARM?</h3><p>Unfortunately, the native ARM app for Windows must be postponed due to a bug in the JDK framework. We are working on a fix but cannot announce a release date yet.</p><h2 id=update-now>Update Now!</h2><p>Cryptomator 1.17.0 is available as usual via our download page. We highly recommend updating.</p><p>As always, we look forward to your feedback — whether on <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator>GitHub</a>, <a href=https://www.facebook.com/Cryptomator>Facebook</a>, <a href=https://www.instagram.com/cryptomator/>Instagram</a>, <a href=https://mastodon.online/@cryptomator>Mastodon</a>, or in our <a href=https://community.cryptomator.org>support forum</a>.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator 1.16.0 is here - with practical new features!</h2><p>The latest version of our desktop app has been released! <strong>Cryptomator 1.16.0</strong> introduces several exciting new features that make working with encrypted files even more convenient.

With the new <strong>EventView</strong>, you now get a clear overview of relevant events within an unlocked vault – such as conflict resolutions or notifications about corrupted files. This way, you always stay informed about what&rsquo;s happening inside your vault.</p><figure class=text-center><img class="inline-block rounded-sm max-h-[430px]" src=/img/blog/desktop-1.16.0-eventview.png alt="EventView in Cryptomator 1.16.0"></figure><p><strong>Decrypt File Names</strong><br>With the new <strong>Decrypt File Name</strong> feature, you can select encrypted files within a vault and retrieve their original, unencrypted filenames – without needing to open the file itself.

This makes using Cryptomator not only faster but also more convenient and secure – especially on devices with biometric authentication. Thanks to <a href=https://github.com/purejava>Ralph (purejava on GitHub)</a> for the great support!</p><figure class=text-center><img class="inline-block rounded-sm max-h-[408px]" src=/img/blog/desktop-1.16.0-touchid.png alt="Touch ID support in Cryptomator 1.16.0"></figure><h3 id=bugfixes>Bugfixes</h3><p>Of course, we also <strong>fixed several bugs</strong> – here’s a quick overview:</p><ul><li>The <strong>main window</strong> is now displayed correctly again on Windows.</li><li>The <strong>tray icon</strong> now reliably adapts to the OS theme on Linux. Thanks again to Ralph for the help!</li><li>The app now properly quits when the main window is closed (if no tray is active).</li><li><strong>Supporter certificates</strong> can now be properly removed again.</li><li>In case of <strong>filename conflicts</strong>, the original suffixes provided by your cloud service are now largely preserved – instead of being replaced by a simple numbering system.</li></ul><h3 id=full-changelog-on-github>Full Changelog on GitHub</h3><p>In addition to the highlights mentioned above, there are also <strong>several smaller improvements and updates</strong> – such as enhancements to vault settings, better symbolic icon support on Linux, and translation updates.

In this article, you’ll find all the essential details about the latest features and bug fixes.</p><h2 id=the-most-important-updates-at-a-glance>The most important updates at a glance:</h2><ul><li>Quick Access feature for faster access to vaults.</li><li>Bug fix in CryptoFS regarding file modification dates.</li><li>Bug fix for using Dropbox vaults and Microsoft Office on Windows.</li></ul><h2 id=whats-new>What’s new?</h2><p><strong>Quick Access Features</strong></p><p>Speed and efficiency are crucial for productive work. With the new &ldquo;Quick Access&rdquo; feature, Cryptomator now simplifies direct access to vaults in the file manager.</p><p>The new &ldquo;Quick Access&rdquo; feature provides quick vault access directly in the file manager and is enabled by default. &ldquo;Quick Access&rdquo; is available for Windows and all major Linux distributions; however, macOS support is currently unavailable due to missing system interfaces.</p><p>Check out the new feature in action in the following video.</p><p><em>Ubuntu(Linux):</em>

Now, this is also possible with Cryptomator on Linux! In the app’s settings, you can configure whether Cryptomator should start automatically when you log in. This feature supports the GNOME and KDE desktop environments and is available when installed via AUR, PPA, or DEB.</p><figure class=text-center><img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src=/img/blog/auto-start.png srcset="/img/blog/auto-start.png 1x, /img/blog/auto-start@2x.png 2x" alt="Auto Start on Linux"></figure><h2 id=bug-fixes>Bug Fixes</h2><p><strong>Cryptofs, lastModified & pCloud</strong></p><p>Good news for all pCloud users! Previously, pCloud users encountered the issue where the &ldquo;last modified&rdquo; date was incorrectly set to &ldquo;today&rdquo; whenever a file was copied into a vault. We’ve fixed this problem in Cryptomator’s native file system, CryptoFS. The fix also addressed issues with other cloud providers/storage locations (including FAT32-formatted USB sticks).</p><p><strong>Microsoft Office and Dropbox</strong></p><p>Editing Microsoft Office documents in a Dropbox vault on Windows occasionally led to data loss. The reason: The &ldquo;WinFsp&rdquo; drive type is incompatible with both Microsoft Office and Dropbox, but &ldquo;WinFsp&rdquo; is the default on Windows.

It contains a lot of internal changes and a bunch of new features, some of which are almost as old as Cryptomator itself.</p><p>We are very proud of this release, as it eliminates technical debt, delivers long-awaited features, and prepares Cryptomator Desktop for the future. But putting aside about 3,000 lines of code changes and a 4-month development iteration (not counting work in our libraries), let&rsquo;s dive into this release to see what you, the user, will get out of it.</p><figure class=text-center><img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src=/img/blog/cryptomator-1-7-0.png srcset="/img/blog/cryptomator-1-7-0.png 1x, /img/blog/cryptomator-1-7-0@2x.png 2x" alt="Cryptomator 1.7.0 Release"></figure><h2 id=locate-encrypted-file>Locate Encrypted File</h2><p>As already mentioned, Cryptomator 1.7.0 includes a feature that has been requested for a very long time: Locating the encrypted counterpart of a file. Sounds complex, but once you remember that Cryptomator encrypts filenames and obfuscates the directory structure (<a href=https://docs.cryptomator.org/security/vault/#filename-encryption>see our docs</a>), it is easy to understand.</p><p>Prior to 1.7.0, you had to guess which encrypted file corresponds to which cleartext file based on the exact timestamps. Now, once the vault is unlocked, the encrypted counterpart of any file in the vault can be revealed by clicking on the &ldquo;Locate Encrypted File&rdquo; button and selecting a file in the vault. Or you can simply drag and drop the files from your vault onto this button. See for yourself in this short video:</p><video class=rounded-sm autoplay loop muted playsinline>
<source src=https://static.cryptomator.org/blog/locate-encrypted-file.mov type=video/mp4>Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><h2 id=experimental-support-for-fuse-t>Experimental Support for FUSE-T</h2><p>On macOS, Cryptomator can use two different technologies to integrate your vault into the system: macFUSE and WebDAV. Unfortunately, the WebDAV implementation on macOS is not the most reliable one. Starting with Apple Silicon Macs, it became unusable for some users who reported system freezes. To make matters worse, macFUSE, which has been the preferred option for at least 3 years, is also on its last legs. Apple has deprecated the OS APIs used by macFUSE since macOS 12.3.</p><p>For the past year, we have been desperately searching for an alternative. Our proof of concept using Apple&rsquo;s File Provider framework was not very convincing and would basically require a whole new architecture. Fortunately, you, our community, informed us about an alternative: <a href=https://www.fuse-t.org/>FUSE-T</a>.</p><p>FUSE-T is a young project that does not rely on deprecated macOS APIs and can be used as a drop-in-replacement for macFUSE. It requires a much less deep system integration than macFUSE while offering a similar performance. This makes Cryptomator ready for the medium-term future on macOS. But since FUSE-T is quite young, support for it is experimental for now. We encourage you to try it though!</p><figure class=text-center><img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src=/img/blog/preferences-fuse-t.png srcset="/img/blog/preferences-fuse-t.png 1x, /img/blog/preferences-fuse-t@2x.png 2x" alt="Experimental Support for FUSE-T"></figure><p>So, while the File Provider extension is not out of our sight, we are relieved to be able to offer you a stable system integration of your Cryptomator vaults.</p><h2 id=volume-types-overhaul>Volume Types Overhaul</h2><p>Looking at the screenshot above, you might have noticed: The volume types have changed, too. That&rsquo;s right, and that&rsquo;s because we rewrote the entire volume type selection and internal wiring logic. It was a huge development effort, but it resulted in a less complex and easier to maintain architecture under the hood. It also resulted in more options for you.</p><h3 id=more-options>More Options</h3><p>The old implementation basically offered 3 (or 2) options: WebDAV, Dokany, and FUSE. Now, specialized implementations are offered for each OS. For example, on Windows you can select between WinFsp, WinFsp (Local Drive), Dokany, WebDAV (Windows Explorer) and WebDAV (Fallback).</p><p>But don&rsquo;t worry, this selection is only important if you have special requirements for the virtual drive. Otherwise, Cryptomator has a new &ldquo;Automatic&rdquo; option and is set up to choose the best suited option for you, and you don&rsquo;t need to worry about it.</p><p>We have even added an emergency option: The aforementioned &ldquo;WebDAV (Fallback)&rdquo;. If you can&rsquo;t mount your vault at all, it makes your vault accessible via a local-only server using the web standard WebDAV. We&rsquo;ll have a guide describing this in more detail soon.</p><h3 id=winfsp-change-local-vs-network-drive>WinFsp Change: Local vs. Network Drive</h3><p>Windows users may notice that their vault is now mounted as a network drive by default. This has the advantage of better performance when listing large directories. The disadvantage is that it cannot be mounted into a directory. Accessing the vault as a privileged user is still possible by using the UNC path.</p><figure class=text-center><img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src=/img/blog/winfsp-change.png srcset="/img/blog/winfsp-change.png 1x, /img/blog/winfsp-change@2x.png 2x" alt="WinFsp Change: Local vs. Network Drive"></figure><p>If you really need a local drive, you can always change the volume type in the preferences.</p><h3 id=dokany-deprecation>Dokany Deprecation</h3><p>With the release of Cryptomator 1.7.0, we will officially deprecate Dokany support.</p><p><a href=https://dokan-dev.github.io/>Dokany</a>, like FUSE, provides a file system interface to mount virtual drives without requiring elevated privileges. We started supporting Dokany 3 years ago with version 1.4.0. But things didn&rsquo;t go as smoothly with the Dokany volume as we had hoped, so we decided to focus our development efforts on a single file system interface. All Dokany-related issues on GitHub will be closed, and our general recommendation is to use WinFSP which comes with the EXE installer of Cryptomator. You will still be able to use Dokany, but it won&rsquo;t get any updates and support will eventually be removed.</p><p>It was a great time, and we wish the Dokany project all the best!</p><h2 id=linux-aarch64-builds>Linux AArch64 Builds</h2><p>With Cryptomator 1.7.0, we&rsquo;ll finally ship AArch64 builds of Cryptomator via Flatpak and PPA.</p><p>One big obstacle was the aforementioned FUSE file system API on Linux. We were using a rather old project to build the bridge between Cryptomator and FUSE. Thanks to a fantastic development effort started by our lead architect, we now use state-of-the-art technology to implement this bridge. The result is bundled in the library called <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/jfuse>jFUSE</a>. Not only were we able to change the bridge, we were also able to update to a new major version of FUSE and pave the way to support features like extended attributes.</p><p>The AppImage is still x86_x64 only, but we plan to deliver it also in AArch64 architecture eventually.</p><h2 id=aes-gcm-new-default-for-content-encryption>AES-GCM: New Default for Content Encryption</h2><p>Starting with Cryptomator 1.7.0, newly created vaults will use <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode>AES-GCM</a> instead of AES-CTR+HMAC for file content encryption.</p><p>Nowadays, almost all non-embedded devices offer hardware acceleration of the Galois/Counter Mode of operation, so encryption and decryption should be significantly faster than in the old mode of operation. The support in our underlying cryptographic library <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptolib>cryptolib</a> was already added in June 2021 with version 2.0.0. But instead of jumping the gun, we gave it a proper testing period and are now confident to ship this improvement to you.</p><p>Of course, our mobile apps also support AES-GCM, although vaults created in iOS or Android will continue to use AES-CTR+HMAC for the time being. The mobile apps are scheduled to switch in their next minor release.</p><p>You can continue to use your existing vaults as before. There are no vault upgrades and there is no action required on your part. Cryptomator will support both modes of operation.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator Roadmap Early 2022</h2><p>There have been a lot of changes in the past year. With this roadmap, we want to give you an overview of what has changed in Cryptomator and what you can look forward to in the coming months.</p><h2 id=ios-version>iOS Version</h2><p>At the end of last year, we were finally able to introduce our new iOS app. One of the main features is the full integration with Apple&rsquo;s own Files app. We also made it possible to offer you a &ldquo;freemium&rdquo; version of the app. If you want to know even more about the new features, check out this <a href=https://cryptomator.org/blog/2021/12/21/ios-2.0/>blog post</a>. Since then, we&rsquo;ve been working on bringing you more features through several updates, such as the auto-lock feature that came with version 2.1.0. With the just released version 2.2.0, we integrated pCloud and added support for shortcuts in Google Drive.</p><p>We have a lot more planned for the app in the coming months. We will integrate Cryptomator into <a href=https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios>Shortcuts</a> so that automation processes such as &ldquo;auto photo upload&rdquo; are possible. We also plan to integrate S3, as we did with our Android app.</p><h2 id=android-version>Android Version</h2><p>Over the past few months, we have been working on increasing the compatibility of Cryptomator. This includes the fact that we now support pCloud, S3, and Vault Format 8. Thanks again Manuel (mjenny on GitHub) for contributing support for pCloud and S3. Also, Cryptomator can now be installed and updated via F-Droid. Vaults in Google Drive can now be used via shortcuts in locations outside of &ldquo;My Drive&rdquo;. This works in &ldquo;Shared with Me&rdquo;, &ldquo;My Computer&rdquo;, and &ldquo;My Drive&rdquo; for example. With OneDrive, it is possible to use multiple accounts at the same time. We will make this feature available for Dropbox and Google Drive in the future. In addition, a &ldquo;real&rdquo; auto photo upload is available in the Android version, meaning new pictures and videos are now uploaded not only after unlocking the vault, but directly when it is unlocked.</p><p>In the coming months, we will switch the Android app to a freemium model, as we did with iOS, and continue to work on the long-awaited document provider.</p><h2 id=desktop-version>Desktop Version</h2><p>With version 1.6.0 announced in the last roadmap, we introduced Vault Format 8 for our Desktop version. You can read more about it <a href=https://cryptomator.org/blog/2021/10/11/vault-format-8/>here</a>. For better usability, we have introduced error codes and a <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/discussions/categories/errors>knowledge base</a> of those, where you can look up solutions for the issue you’ve encountered. We also introduced an auto-lock feature that automatically locks the vaults after a self-defined inactivity time as well as a plugin API. The first plugin for Cryptomator is the <a href=https://plugin.purejava.org/>KeePassXC plugin</a> via an open-source contribution by Ralph (purejava on GitHub). Furthermore, we improved our build systems so that applications/installers for all operating systems are automatically built and signed (instead of manually).</p><p>Two years ago, one might remember that we announced to focus our efforts on Flatpak distribution. However, that didn’t go as planned and progress on it came to a halt… until recently. Our regular open-source contributor Ralph (purejava on GitHub) once again came to our rescue. And we actually did it! Cryptomator is now <a href=https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.cryptomator.Cryptomator>available on Flathub as a Flatpak app</a>. Again, huge thanks to Ralph for his amazing contribution!</p><p>For the Desktop version of Cryptomator, we have some major topics coming up in the near future. On the one hand, we are working on a major FUSE refactoring. Among other things, this is necessary to be able to offer ARM64 support on Windows and Linux as well. On Apple Silicon Macs, we have already supported this for a few releases. On the other hand, we want to address the open issues related to <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/projects/13>extended attributes</a>. More precisely, we are talking about additional file attributes that enable tagging and fix compatibility issues. Of course, these attributes will be encrypted just like the filename.</p><p>If you read this far, we’d like to share a secret with you. We are currently working on <a href=https://cryptomator.org/hub/>Cryptomator Hub</a>. That’s it for now but you’ll definitely hear more about it this year.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator 1.6.7 Release: Major Changes on Windows</h2><p>Hello Community!</p><p>The last blog post is already a while ago. We hope you&rsquo;re all doing fine. Cryptomator 1.6.7 for Desktop is out now and let&rsquo;s explore the changes together since it&rsquo;s more than just a &ldquo;patch&rdquo;! The update contains some noteworthy changes, especially for Windows users.</p><h2 id=new-installer>New Installer</h2><p>With Cryptomator 1.6.0, instead of delivering a &ldquo;regular&rdquo; executable for installation, we provided a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Installer>Windows Installer package</a> to allow easier scripted deployment of Cryptomator. But this approach also had drawbacks: We couldn&rsquo;t bundle third-party drivers (i.e., Dokany) leading to inferior user experience.</p><p>These dire times are over! When you head over to <a href=/downloads/>downloads</a> and select Windows, you&rsquo;re getting an executable again that bundles the MSI installer as well as additional dependencies. Furthermore, it supports command-line parameters (e.g., <code>/quiet</code>). For a complete list, run the installer with the <code>/?</code> parameter.</p><p>If you want to download the &ldquo;pure&rdquo; MSI installer without dependencies, it&rsquo;s also available on the downloads site or head over to the <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.6.7>release on GitHub</a>.</p><h2 id=new-default-vfs-driver-virtual-volume>New Default VFS Driver (Virtual Volume)</h2><p>As already mentioned, the new EXE installer can include dependencies again, so we added one right from the start: <a href=https://winfsp.dev/>WinFsp</a>.</p><p>This decision is mainly based on the long-term maintenance effort. The integration of a vault into the OS currently supports WebDAV (legacy), Dokany (Windows), and FUSE (all systems). FUSE support (provided by WinFSP) on Windows is now available for quite a while and feedback was very promising. The time has come to make this the default choice so we can focus on a common code base.</p><p>WebDAV and Dokany will remain part of Cryptomator, should you prefer it in your individual setup. Please note that Dokany 2.x is not yet supported and our existing Dokany 1.x glue code requires a migration.</p><p>There are some known issues with WinFsp though:</p><ul><li>If you are logged in to Windows via an AzureAD account, vaults can only be accessed read-only.</li><li>Access with the admin rights is only possible when the vault is mounted into a directory (as opposed to a drive letter).</li></ul><p>If you aren&rsquo;t affected by any of these issues, we encourage you to use WinFsp/FUSE.</p><p>Those were the two major changes you should know about. For all changes, have a look at the <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.6.7>changelog</a>.</p><p>We hope you are enjoying this Cryptomator update.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator Roadmap Early 2021</h2><p>Development on Cryptomator 1.5.x is coming to an end and we are now working on the next major version 1.6.x. Read more about it in this roadmap!</p><h2 id=state-of-the-desktop-app>State of the Desktop App</h2><p>The update to version 1.6.0 is just around the corner! The release will mainly contain some invisible changes that will allow us to add new features in a timely manner. One of the main points here is to implement a new vault format (Vault Format 8). It makes the integration of <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/projects/8>other authentication methods</a> in the future possible, for example to enable 2FA.</p><p>Another feature is the <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/projects/7>integration of a sanitizer</a>. Until now, a separate program was needed to check the state of your vault and to execute cleanup and restore commands. In the future, this will be possible directly in the Cryptomator user interface.</p><p>In addition, there is now a prototype for the distribution of Cryptomator as a Microsoft Software Installation (.msi), but the implementation still has alpha character. Furthermore, we have updated Cryptomator to JDK 16 with the latest <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.5.14>version 1.5.14</a>, which brings some upstream fixes. Unfortunately, we could not make any progress with regard to Flatpak.</p><h2 id=state-of-the-android-app>State of the Android App</h2><p>As you might have noticed in our blog, we finally published the source code of the app! Apart from that, vault format 8 is also a big topic in our development here.</p><p>Since the update to version 1.5.14 (currently still in a beta version), pCloud is natively supported by Cryptomator. Many thanks to Manu for <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/android/pull/283>his open source contribution</a>! Another small change is that since the update 1.5.13, it is possible to sort the vault list and thus get a better overview of the vaults.</p><p>But that&rsquo;s not all we have planned for the Android app! We are happy to release Cryptomator on F-Droid soon. Also, we hope to be able to include more clouds soon and enable access to content of the vault via third-party apps with a &ldquo;document provider&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=state-of-the-ios-app>State of the iOS App</h2><p>With the introduction of vault format 8, the &ldquo;old&rdquo; iOS app will probably get its last major update to version 1.6.0.</p><p>Meanwhile, work on the &ldquo;new&rdquo; iOS app continues. As announced in the last roadmap, the iOS app will be fully integrated into the Files app. We are already very far along. Nevertheless, we still have some work to do, as we want to offer some features like dark mode or support for multiple accounts from the same cloud provider right from the start.</p><p>We can&rsquo;t promise you an exact release date yet, but we hope we will release a first beta version via TestFlight in the summer.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator Roadmap Late 2020</h2><p>We recently released Cryptomator 1.5.10 for Windows, macOS, and Linux with many new features and bugfixes. Well, actually the changes were in 1.5.9 but we followed it up with a hotfix release. &#x1f601; With the (crazy) year nearing its end, we&rsquo;d like to give you some insight to our roadmap across all platforms for the upcoming months!</p><h2 id=state-of-the-desktop-app>State of the Desktop App</h2><p>With the redesign and full rewrite of the UI in 1.5.0, we established a good foundation for adding further features. There was one former feature that didn&rsquo;t make the cut though, which is now back with the latest version: Vault Statistics. &#x1f389;</p><figure class=text-center><img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src=/img/blog/vault-statistics.png srcset="/img/blog/vault-statistics.png 1x, /img/blog/vault-statistics@2x.png 2x" alt="Vault Statistics in Cryptomator"></figure><p>We didn&rsquo;t stop there! Vault passwords can now also be stored in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KWallet>KWallet</a> on Linux. Huge thanks to Ralph Plawetzki (purejava on GitHub) for his contribution! And last but not least, it is now possible to mount the vault via FUSE on Windows. This is still a beta feature! In order to try it, <a href=http://www.secfs.net/winfsp/>WinFSP</a> needs to be installed. We&rsquo;d love to hear your feedback on this!</p><p>On the distribution front, we didn&rsquo;t quite meet our expectations. So far, we&rsquo;ve been struggling with Flatpak as we just can&rsquo;t convince its sandbox to properly support FUSE drives. But we&rsquo;re not giving up on this!</p><p>Behind the UI, we introduced the <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/integrations-api>integrations-api</a> alongside implementations for each OS. It&rsquo;s a new way for Cryptomator to include native (also OS-specific) functionalities. Now easier than ever, you can implement native functions. So grab your keyboard and start hacking! &#x1f601; With this change, we archived the old <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/native-functions>native-functions</a> repository. &#x1f44b;</p><p>What&rsquo;s next? Our plan is to move on to 1.6.x. First of all, we want to integrate <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/sanitizer>Sanitizer</a>, so you can check your vault health and run cleanup and recovery tasks right within the Cryptomator UI. Furthermore, by decoupling the key derivation from the vault encryption, we plan to give you more options for authentication, including third-party password storage, 2FA, and multi-user access using individual passwords.</p><h2 id=state-of-the-android-app>State of the Android App</h2><p>In the last months, we added new features like <a href=https://community.cryptomator.org/t/biometric-authentication-e-g-face-unlock-coming-soon/6089>face unlock</a>, <a href=https://community.cryptomator.org/t/sort-directory-listings/5958>sort directory listings</a>, and <a href=https://community.cryptomator.org/t/search-in-current-folder-using-glob-pattern-matching/5928>search using glob pattern matching</a>. Some community members also translated the app to <a href=https://community.cryptomator.org/t/translated-into-french/5962>French</a> and <a href=https://community.cryptomator.org/t/cryptomator-is-soon-available-in-turkish/6560>Turkish</a>. Many thanks for their contributions!</p><p>Looking forward, we have some exciting news about our Android app! The project is in the perfect situation to fulfill the two biggest wishes of the community:</p><ol><li>Open Source: Publishing the source code of the app.</li><li>Document Provider: Accessing the content of the vault using third-party apps.</li></ol><p>You heard that right, we are going to open-source Cryptomator for Android! The fact that the app is open-core had its legitimate reasons but we are now fully confident that we can open-source the app without compromises. We are working hard to publish the complete source code within a few weeks.</p><p>After that, the highly anticipated Document Provider feature will be on our roadmap.</p><h2 id=state-of-the-ios-app>State of the iOS App</h2><p>What&rsquo;s up with Cryptomator for iOS? For the last 6-7 months, we have been hard at work on a <em>completely</em> new app written in Swift. Our first efforts can already be seen in our new open-source libraries for Swift: <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptolib-swift>cryptolib-swift</a> and <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cloud-access-swift>cloud-access-swift</a>.</p><p>What will be so special about the rewrite? Cryptomator will be fully integrated into the Files app. This comes with many benefits like thumbnails, support for third-party apps that can edit files directly inside the vault, and many more! But that also means, there won&rsquo;t be a &ldquo;custom&rdquo; file browser inside the app anymore. Integration into the Files app is one of the most requested features of the community.</p><p>What about open source? We won&rsquo;t open-source the current app anymore because we&rsquo;d like to look forward.

It is not simply a redesign, it was a full rewrite of the UI. During the rewrite, a whole new code structure was planned which makes it easier to extend the application in the future. One goal of the redesign was to make the onboarding process easier for users who don&rsquo;t feel too comfortable with encryption software. Usability tests helped designing the workflows and understanding common misconceptions. Besides the redesign, the new vault format 7 increases compatibility with some cloud services and at the same time reduces the complexity for certain I/O operations.</p><p>To support the ongoing open-source development of Cryptomator, consider <a href=/donate/>buying a donation key</a>, which unlocks the new dark mode. &#x2764;&#xfe0f; <a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.5.0 target=_blank rel=noopener>Detailed release notes</a> for the desktop app are available on GitHub.</p><p>As you might have noticed, this website is also shining in a completely new design. &#x2728;</p><h2 id=cryptomator-for-ios--android>Cryptomator for iOS & Android</h2><p>New updates for iOS and Android have been released as well. To celebrate the release, our mobile apps are 40% off until April 23! &#x1f916;</p><p>Cryptomator for Android is now also available as an APK version <a href=/android/>through our own online store</a>.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator Roadmap Early 2020</h2><p>Between all the work on Cryptomator, we need to remind ourselves to not forget about our regular updates post. While most of you have already noticed that we&rsquo;re approaching a new major release of Cryptomator, I think it is time to inform you where we&rsquo;re currently standing and what our roadmap looks like.</p><h2 id=state-of-our-desktop-application>State of our Desktop Application</h2><p>We plan to release 1.5.0 within Q1 2020. In our currently running beta (huge shout-outs to all the helpful test feedback), we have already sorted out several problems and feel confident to deliver outstanding quality.</p><p>While we have already discussed <a href="https://community.cryptomator.org/t/handling-of-long-filenames-in-cryptomator-1-5-0/4191?u=overheadhunter">upcoming changes</a> to what we call the <em>vault format</em> (i.e. the layout of the encrypted files and directory) to increase compatibility with some cloud services and at the same time reduce the complexity for certain I/O operations, the far more obvious change affects the GUI:</p><p>We did not simply <em>redesign</em> our UI, we did a full <em>rewrite</em> of it. Nearly every single line of code that was involved in Cryptomator 1.4.x has been deleted. Why would you do something like this? Well, the application grew over time. Cryptomator has been started more than six years ago and some concepts weren&rsquo;t established back then that make development easier today. During the rewrite, we planned a whole new code structure which makes it easier to extend the application in the future and at the same time have new developers understand what parts of the code is responsible for what dialog in the software.</p><p>One goal of the redesign was to make the onboarding process easier for users who don&rsquo;t feel too comfortable with encryption software. We attended (and organized) some usability tests in our vicinity and saw how first-time users reacted to the vault creation process. This helped us to design the workflows and understand common misconceptions.</p><h2 id=state-of-the-android-app>State of the Android App</h2><p>Not worth mentioning is that the Android app in 1.5.0 will support vault format 7. In the Android app, we focused on implementing new features and improving stability:</p><ul><li>Already opened files are cached on the smartphone. When reopened and if the file has not changed in the cloud, the file is loaded from the local file system, which leads to a huge performance improvement.</li><li>Fixed and improved auto photo upload e.g., after device reboot or on Android 10 under certain conditions the upload didn’t work</li><li>We added an option to lock a vault immediately when Cryptomator is closed or in background</li><li>Last but not least, we&rsquo;ve put a lot of work into a new license store that will enable us to provide an alternative way of distributing our Android app, as we have a lot of requests from users who prefer not to use Google services such as the Play Store</li></ul><h2 id=state-of-the-ios-app>State of the iOS App</h2><p>The iOS app will also support vault format 7, obviously. There are some further fixes and improvements under the hood, but no new features. It already supports caching and it you can even buy it without using the Google Play Store. &#x1f609;</p><h2 id=what-is-missing-for-the-final-release-of-150>What is missing for the final release of 1.5.0?</h2><p>While at the time of writing this, there are only few missing features planned for 1.5.0 (such as vault recovery) and only some final polishing is required from our side, we want to make sure our mobile apps and also third party apps such as Cyberduck are ready to deal with the new vault format, too. For some bugs scheduled for 1.5.0 (such as <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/986>this one</a>), we&rsquo;re currently waiting for an upstream fix.</p><p>Simultaneously, we&rsquo;re preparing new documentation pages for 1.5.0 as well as a new website with a new FAQ section and we integrate <a href="https://community.cryptomator.org/t/localization-of-cryptomator-1-5-0/4269?u=overheadhunter">new translations</a> added by our great community on a regular basis.</p><h2 id=whats-up-next>What&rsquo;s up next?</h2><p>Our first priority right after 1.5.0 is to migrate from Java 11 to Java 14. Java 14 includes a long-awaited new tool that is required for our packaging. We&rsquo;re currently using a workaround that prevents us from upgrading to the latest bundled JRE. This is a small change that will probably be shipped right with 1.5.1. However, we didn&rsquo;t want to dig up new holes right before 1.5.0 and decided to postpone this to 1.5.1.</p><p>Next, we want to focus on Flatpak. We ditched <code>.deb</code> and <code>.rpm</code> files some time ago and replaced them with AppImages. We also really like how the Flatpak ecosystem is gaining traction and is supported natively by a steadily increasing number of distributions. So far, <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/729>we didn&rsquo;t get Cryptomator working</a> due to the complexity behind the file system mounts. But after we&rsquo;ve finished 1.5.0, we hope to be able to put some more attention to this and solve this to ship Cryptomator as a Flatpak soon.</p><p>In the Android app, the next big feature will be accessing files of a Cryptomator vault inside other apps using a DocumentProvider. For example, a file explorer will be able to access the content of the vault in this way. As well as smaller features like recursive upload of folders to the vault are planned.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator Roadmap Mid 2019</h2><p>We would like to take a more regular look at our roadmap to publicly document the past, present, and future developments of Cryptomator. Unlike before, we&rsquo;re also going to have a look at the roadmaps of our mobile apps.</p><h2 id=desktop>Desktop</h2><p>In the desktop area, we are currently pursuing two different branches: On the one hand we are striving for feature completion of 1.4.x, with 1.4.12 already available as a release candidate. It will finally allow Linux users to store their password in the system and include the much desired &ldquo;Custom Mount Flags&rdquo; feature.</p><ul><li><strong>Save password in system (Linux):</strong> For a long time, you could only store your vault&rsquo;s password in the system under macOS and Windows. Through a community contribution, this is now finally also possible under (some) Linux systems. &#x1f604; The existence of GNOME Keyring or another keychain via Secret Service API is required. Many thanks to Ralph Plawetzki (purejava on GitHub) and Sebastian Wiesendahl (swiesend on GitHub) for the implementation!</li><li><strong>Custom Mount Flags:</strong> Cryptomator uses default options to mount a drive (both for Dokany and FUSE) that we chose for security or performance reasons. However, this leads to limited functionality in some cases and users who want to set their own options can now change them. Be aware: <em>Use at your own risk!</em></li></ul><p>On the other hand the implementation of 1.5.0 has already started. For 1.5.0, as announced, we want to fully concentrate on the redesign of the user interface and improve the internal processing of Cryptomator, because like many open-source projects it has grown organically over time and therefore needs a good refactoring. &#x1f609;</p><h2 id=ios>iOS</h2><p>After the release of Cryptomator 1.4.0 for iOS with built-in cache functionality, which on the one hand avoids repeated downloading of files and on the other hand allows (limited) offline access, the work on Cryptomator 1.5.0 for iOS has started.</p><p>The main focus will be the integration into the Files app of iOS. The first step will be the expansion of our <a class=text-link href=https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/FileProvider.html target=_blank rel=noopener>Document Provider</a> which is going to be extended by the methods &ldquo;Open&rdquo; and &ldquo;Move&rdquo;. This will make a direct access to files within a Cryptomator vault from other apps possible without having to copy them back and forth.</p><h2 id=android>Android</h2><p>Cryptomator 1.4.0 for Android is currently being finalized with the following features, which can already be tested in a beta version:</p><ul><li><strong>Automatic photo upload:</strong> After activation, all images created on the smartphone will be uploaded the next time the selected vault is unlocked.</li><li><strong>Make files writable by third-party apps:</strong> Files that are opened can be edited in third-party apps. When you finish the editing process by saving and returning to the Cryptomator app, the changes are transferred to the cloud.</li></ul><p>We are considering these features for future versions:</p><ul><li><strong>LRU Cache:</strong> To save network traffic, certain server responses are cached to avoid repeated downloading, for example of unmodified images from the cloud.</li><li><strong>Support for Google Team Drives:</strong> Access to vaults located in Google Team Drive should be made possible.</li><li><strong>Distribution of the app outside of Google Play:</strong> Cryptomator for Android should also be available from alternative sources. We are thinking about setting up a licensing system, through which a license could be purchased directly.</li><li><strong>Unlocking with system password:</strong> You should be able to use the system password of the smartphone to open vaults. (Similar to unlocking with a fingerprint.)</li><li><strong>Access to files via DocumentProvider:</strong> Access to a Cryptomator vault inside other apps should be made possible via a DocumentProvider. For example, a file explorer would then be able to access the vault in this way.</li><li><strong>Upload of directories (recursive):</strong> The download of whole folders already works, the upload including all subfolders is not possible yet.</li></ul></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator Roadmap Early 2019</h2><p>Hey it&rsquo;s a new year, so here comes our <del>quarterly</del> annual &#x1f648; roadmap preview.</p><h3 id=openjdk-and-openjfx>OpenJDK and OpenJFX</h3><p>Until now we&rsquo;ve been using Oracle JDK, since this included the GUI library we used for Cryptomator: JavaFX. Beginning with JDK 11, we plan to switch to OpenJDK and OpenJFX. JavaFX will no longer be included in the Oracle JDK anyway and OpenJFX promises shorter release cycles and - as the name suggests - is developed in an open process.</p><p>Since we no longer depend on non-free software, Cryptomator could theoretically move from &ldquo;contrib&rdquo; to &ldquo;main&rdquo; in Debian repos.</p><p>We also hope that building Cryptomator becomes easier, since OpenJFX is a normal dependency and you no longer need to install the Oracle JDK.</p><h3 id=symlinks>Symlinks</h3><p>We have successfully moved to FUSE (Linux and macOS) and Dokany (Windows). Now it is time to improve the file systems. One of the most asked features is support for symbolic links. If you don&rsquo;t know what this is, don&rsquo;t worry. For everyone else: Stay tuned for a 1.4.x update introducing symlinks.</p><h3 id=ui-redesign>UI Redesign</h3><p>We plan to redesign the whole user interface from scratch with Cryptomator 1.5.0.

md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator Roadmap Early 2018</h2><p>Since it is understandable that not all of our users can track all development activities on GitHub, I would like to write a few paragraphs here about the technical updates that are planned for Cryptomator in 2018 and their impact on usage.</p><h3 id=fuse>FUSE</h3><p>The biggest upcoming change is the implementation of FUSE-based drives. This will be <em>additional</em> to WebDAV and will become the new default setting. We are currently developing the <a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/fuse-nio-adapter target=_blank rel=noopener>necessary library</a>. It is based on <a class=text-link href=https://github.com/SerCeMan/jnr-fuse target=_blank rel=noopener>jnr-fuse</a>, which means you need <em>FUSE for macOS</em> or <em>WinFsp</em> in case of Windows. The Linux kernel supports FUSE out of the box.</p><p>A big challenge at the moment is how to include <em>WinFsp</em> or <em>FUSE for macOS</em> in the installer. First test versions will therefore require manual installation of named libraries.</p><p>The benefit of using FUSE lies not only in performance enhancements (which are already clearly measurable in the current state of development for some file/directory operations) but also in the expected increase in compatibility with third-party software. There are several problems related to the WebDAV drive, as can be seen in <a class=text-link href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Amisc%3Awebdav" target=_blank rel=noopener>our issues list</a>.</p><h3 id=java-9>Java 9</h3><p>During the Christmas holidays, I made all libraries and the desktop application compatible with Java 9. Our <a class=text-link href=https://travis-ci.org/cryptomator/ target=_blank rel=noopener>CI builds</a> now run uniformly with JDK 9 in containers. However, the code is still compiled for older Java versions, not just because our Android app depends on it.</p><p>What&rsquo;s the point? Java 9 is a huge step in the development of the Java platform. In addition to various bug fixes that directly benefit Cryptomator users, e.g. better support for HiDPI displays under Windows and Linux, there were massive refactorings which form the basis for a new release model of the Java platform with new <a class=text-link href=https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/faster-and-easier-use-and-redistribution-of-java-se target=_blank rel=noopener>feature releases in six-month cycles</a>. This means that we will be able to benefit from new features in the future more rapidly without having to rely on unstable test versions.</p><p>However, the conversion to Java 9 with Cryptomator 1.4.0 is also the basis for the use of the Java Platform Module System from Cryptomator 1.5.0 onwards, whereby <a class=text-link href=http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/275 target=_blank rel=noopener>much smaller applications</a> can be built. In a first test, the size of the Cryptomator application for macOS was reduced from over 200 MiB (in the installed state) to about 70 MiB.</p><h3 id=intellij>IntelliJ</h3><p>We switched our build platform from Eclipse to IntelliJ because the JDK 9 compatible versions of Eclipse contain changes to the compiler that didn&rsquo;t get along with code generated by <a class=text-link href=https://github.com/google/dagger/issues/949 target=_blank rel=noopener>Dagger</a>.</p><p>Furthermore, our Android developers are already used to IntelliJ so that we can harmonize our tools a little bit here.</p><h3 id=64-bit>64 Bit</h3><p>Since both WinFsp and JDK 9 require 64 bit, Cryptomator will no longer support 32 bit systems as of version 1.4.0. Although this is a pity, it also speeds up the development process because fewer systems have to be tested.</p><p>Cryptomator 1.3.x will be 100% compatible with 1.4.0. This means that users who depend on 32-bit software can continue to use Cryptomator vaults.</p><hr><p>Did you find this insight interesting?

We tried hosting the virtual drive via <code>localhost</code>, <code>127.0.0.1</code>, and <code>::1</code> but every host has its own issue: Sometimes access to the virtual drive was extremely slow, sometimes Windows showed unnecessary security warnings (<a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/529 target=_blank rel=noopener>#529</a>), and sometimes Office didn&rsquo;t properly work (<a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/512 target=_blank rel=noopener>#512</a>). That&rsquo;s why the Windows installer for Cryptomator now writes the new host <code>cryptomator-vault</code> (which is mapped to <code>127.0.0.1</code>) into the <code>hosts</code> file. Weirdly enough, with that new host, all problems seem to be gone. Even though we don&rsquo;t quite understand why binding an IP has such a big impact, we just hope that we finally found a good solution!</p><h3 id=under-the-hood-improvements>Under-The-Hood Improvements</h3><p>We&rsquo;d like to highlight some improvements that we were able to make under-the-hood: Faster build times, high test coverage for our crypto libraries, and more!</p><h4 id=ci-build-times>CI Build Times</h4><p>(<a class=text-link href=https://travis-ci.org/cryptomator/cryptomator/builds target=_blank rel=noopener>Travis CI build numbers are in parentheses</a>)</p><table class="table-fixed w-full"><thead><tr class=border-t><th class="w-1/3 px-4 py-2">Branch</th><th class="w-1/3 px-4 py-2">1.3.0</th><th class="w-1/3 px-4 py-2">1.2.4</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">Master (Release)</th><td class="px-4 py-2">3min (809, 819, 835, 842, 845)</td><td class="px-4 py-2">5min (699, 704, 714, 727, 828)</td></tr><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">Develop</th><td class="px-4 py-2">1.6min (830, 831, 837, 839, 841)</td><td class="px-4 py-2">3min (710, 711, 715, 724, 725)</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id=lines-of-code>Lines of Code</h4><p>(determined via <code>cloc --exclude-dir=test --include-lang=Java</code>)</p><table class="table-fixed w-full"><thead><tr class=border-t><th class="w-1/3 px-4 py-2">Project</th><th class="w-1/3 px-4 py-2">1.3.0</th><th class="w-1/3 px-4 py-2">1.2.4</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">Cryptomator-Desktop</th><td class="px-4 py-2">7,249</td><td class="px-4 py-2">16,624</td></tr><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">CryptoLib</th><td class="px-4 py-2">1,447</td><td class="px-4 py-2">-</td></tr><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">CryptoFS</th><td class="px-4 py-2">6,829</td><td class="px-4 py-2">-</td></tr><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">WebDAV-NIO-Adapter</th><td class="px-4 py-2">3,979</td><td class="px-4 py-2">-</td></tr><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">SIV-Mode</th><td class="px-4 py-2">1,238</td><td class="px-4 py-2">1,238</td></tr><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">Sum</th><td class="px-4 py-2">20,742</td><td class="px-4 py-2">17,862</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id=test-coverage>Test Coverage</h4><p>(determined via JaCoCo)</p><table class="table-fixed w-full"><thead><tr class=border-t><th class="w-1/3 px-4 py-2">Project</th><th class="w-1/3 px-4 py-2">1.3.0</th><th class="w-1/3 px-4 py-2">1.2.4</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">Cryptomator-Desktop</th><td class="px-4 py-2">14%</td><td class="px-4 py-2">66%</td></tr><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">CryptoLib</th><td class="px-4 py-2">93%</td><td class="px-4 py-2">-</td></tr><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">CryptoFS</th><td class="px-4 py-2">97%</td><td class="px-4 py-2">-</td></tr><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">WebDAV-NIO-Adapter</th><td class="px-4 py-2">26%</td><td class="px-4 py-2">-</td></tr><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">SIV-Mode</th><td class="px-4 py-2">96%</td><td class="px-4 py-2">96%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>* passes <a class=text-link href=http://www.webdav.org/neon/litmus/ target=_blank rel=noopener>litmus (WebDAV server test suite)</a></p><h4 id=file-size>File Size</h4><table class="table-fixed w-full"><thead><tr class=border-t><th class="w-1/3 px-4 py-2">File</th><th class="w-1/3 px-4 py-2">1.3.0</th><th class="w-1/3 px-4 py-2">1.2.4</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">Cryptomator.jar</th><td class="px-4 py-2">9.18 MB</td><td class="px-4 py-2">12.1 MB</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=evolution-of-cryptomator>Evolution of Cryptomator</h3><p>(made with Gource)</p><div class="relative aspect-video"><iframe class="absolute w-full h-full" src=https://gfycat.com/ifr/UnlawfulAdmirableAmericanindianhorse frameborder=0 scrolling=no allowfullscreen></iframe></div><hr><h2 id=cryptomator-124-for-ios>Cryptomator 1.2.4 for iOS</h2><ul><li>Added compatibility to vault version 6</li><li>Fixed auto-lock bug, which occurred when you opened up the Touch ID settings (<a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-ios/issues/89 target=_blank rel=noopener>#89</a>)</li><li>Improved filename blacklist, you can now see files and folders that start with a period &ldquo;.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>We weren&rsquo;t able to finish <a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-ios/milestone/11 target=_blank rel=noopener>Cryptomator 1.3.0 for iOS</a> in time.

Well, it&rsquo;s not that mysterious anymore, but this particular error had been haunting us from the beginning! Cycor on GitHub (almost casually) pointed out in <a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/210#issuecomment-262034669 target=_blank rel=noopener>GitHub Issue 210</a> that he found the cause of system error 53/67 after a few months of experiencing the issue himself.</p><p>Apparently, there is a Windows Registry entry responsible for listing available network providers called <a class=text-link href=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc959369.aspx target=_blank rel=noopener>ProviderOrder</a>. Cryptomator&rsquo;s virtual drive is based on WebDAV. Therefore, a missing <code>webclient</code> value in the <code>ProviderOrder</code> registry key would lead to such error. We were stunned, desperate, and hopeless for many months, because we were never able to reproduce the issue. We added things like the IPv6 literal option (which is probably going to be removed in a future version) or thought that some firewall was responsible for the error. But nope! Clearly some applications modify this registry entry, because a clean Windows installation doesn&rsquo;t have the <code>webclient</code> value missing. Shame on them! &#x1f514;</p><p>We fixed this issue by patching the Cryptomator for Windows installer and added some code that adds the <code>webclient</code> value back to the <code>ProviderOrder</code> key, if it is missing. The registry key can be found at <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\NetworkProvider\Order</code>. If you&rsquo;re a fellow developer and stumbled on this blog post while having the same issue and even using Inno Setup yourself, you can <a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-win/blob/master/package/windows/Cryptomator.iss target=_blank rel=noopener>find the code on GitHub</a>.</p><p>Big thanks to Cycor for finding the solution to this weird bug! &#x1f604;</p><p>Furthermore, version 1.2.3 (also available for Mac and Linux) includes other improvements:</p><ul><li>Saved password can now be forgotten by deselecting the checkbox. [Windows/Mac]</li><li>WebDAV server keeps running after unlocking a vault even if mounting fails.</li><li>Log files don&rsquo;t contain debug-level information per default anymore, added debug mode in settings.</li></ul><hr><h2 id=whats-next>What&rsquo;s next?</h2><p>We released <a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptofs target=_blank rel=noopener>CryptoFS</a> in version 1.0.0, which is now ready to be integrated in our main application Cryptomator.

From this version onwards, there is a bijective function for calculating the cleartext size from the ciphertext size and vice versa.</p><p>We always strive to offer the best of both, security and usability. But sometimes we need to find a compromise in order to implement all the features, we&rsquo;re planning for future releases. In the past, we needed to access the first few bytes of a file in order to determine the cleartext file size, which led to <code>O(n)</code> I/O activities with <code>n</code> being the number of files per directories. In this case, we decided in favor of <code>O(1)</code> directory listings, which is especially useful for large directory listings, file size determination via mobile devices, or slow internet connections.</p><p>File size obfuscation has never been a cryptographically effective protection against adversaries getting to know the approximate cleartext size. Anything the size of a movie remained the size of a movie and was most likely not mistaken for a text document. Nevertheless, we will miss you.
