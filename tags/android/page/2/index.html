So why did we choose to add another distribution channel?</p><h2 id=why-accrescent>Why Accrescent?</h2><p>Accrescent aligns with our core values of security, privacy, and user control. It requires no user account and provides features such as signed repository metadata, app signing key pinning, and minimum version enforcement, ensuring that Cryptomator remains a trusted and secure choice for Android users.</p><p>Additionally, Accrescent can be installed with a single click on some custom Android variants like <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GrapheneOS>GrapheneOS</a>, making it an ideal addition to our distribution strategy by offering a seamless installation experience for privacy-conscious users.</p><h2 id=commitment-to-security-and-transparency>Commitment to Security and Transparency</h2><p>Publishing Cryptomator on Accrescent aligns with our core principles. Our primary concern has always been security, privacy and transparency, which is why we value features like app signing key control, verifiable metadata, and the fact that no account is required for usage.</p><p>Each distribution channel we provide offers its own unique benefits and trade-offs, catering to different user needs and preferences. For instance, we appreciate the main F-Droid repository for its <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducible_builds>reproducible build</a> approach, where F-Droid itself builds our APK from the publicly available source code and verifies that the resulting binaries match our published versions. This process provides an additional layer of transparency and trust.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>By making Cryptomator available on <a href=https://accrescent.app/app/org.cryptomator>Accrescent</a>, we are broadening our reach to privacy-conscious users and ensuring a secure distribution channel that aligns with our mission to protect your data. Whether you choose Google Play, APK Store, F-Droid, or Accrescent, you can always rely on Cryptomator for secure, open-source encryption.</p><p>We appreciate your continued support and feedback.

The new 1.10.3 update is now available, providing even stronger protection for your data. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the key improvements.</p><h2 id=key-updates-at-a-glance>Key Updates at a Glance</h2><ul><li>Migrating vault passwords to GCM</li><li>Thai as a new language option</li></ul><h2 id=whats-new>What&rsquo;s New?</h2><h3 id=migrating-vault-passwords-to-gcm>Migrating Vault Passwords to GCM</h3><p>We‚Äôve improved the encryption for vault passwords and cloud credentials! From now on, we‚Äôre using AES-256 GCM instead of AES-256 CBC to provide even stronger protection. Passwords and credentials are still securely stored in the Android Keystore, and your data remains protected in internal storage thanks to Android‚Äôs sandbox model.</p><p>With the app update, existing cloud credentials and vault passwords will automatically migrate to the new format. You may opt out of migrating vault passwords, but if you do, the passwords will be deleted from the app for security reasons.</p><h3 id=new-language-thai>New Language: Thai</h3><p>Another exciting update: The Cryptomator app is now available in Thai! We‚Äôre thrilled to make our app accessible to even more users around the world and grow our community. This new language option makes it easier and more comfortable for Thai users to enjoy Cryptomator.</p><p>A big thank you goes out to our dedicated community for helping us optimize Cryptomator for more countries and languages.

This is the final step in the verification process, and once submitted, we anticipate that Google Drive access will be restored shortly thereafter.</p><p>We are cautiously optimistic that full functionality will be available again within the next few days. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this has caused and appreciate your continued patience and understanding as we work through this final stage.</p><hr><p>Hello Community!</p><p>We would like to inform you about a current issue that some of you may be experiencing while using our Cryptomator apps for Android and iOS. It involves difficulties in connecting to Google Drive that have arisen in the past few days. Here, you will find all the details and updates on our progress in resolving the issue.</p><h2 id=what-happened>What Happened?</h2><p>Google recently introduced significant changes to its app verification system. These changes particularly affect how apps access services like Google Drive. As a result of this update, you may encounter an error message when trying to connect Google Drive with Cryptomator, stating that Cryptomator is blocked because it is an &ldquo;unverified app&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=why-is-this-issue-occurring>Why Is This Issue Occurring?</h2><p>Google has substantially tightened the requirements for app verification, especially for apps that access sensitive user data. This not only affects Cryptomator but potentially all apps that integrate with Google services. The aim of these changes is to enhance user security and protect their data. However, as a consequence, apps that have not yet fully adapted to the new system may be temporarily blocked.</p><h2 id=what-are-we-doing-to-resolve-the-issue>What Are We Doing to Resolve the Issue?</h2><p>We are fully aware of the problem and are working diligently to find a solution. Our team is in close contact with Google to complete the necessary verification processes and re-certify Cryptomator as a trusted app. Unfortunately, this task is more complex than initially anticipated. Google&rsquo;s new requirements necessitate additional adjustments to our app, which must be carefully implemented and tested.</p><p>We want to emphasize that the security of your data is our top priority. Therefore, we are taking the time to thoroughly implement these changes to ensure that Cryptomator remains a secure and reliable solution for your encrypted data.</p><h2 id=what-can-you-do>What Can You Do?</h2><p>We understand that this issue is frustrating for many of you, and we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do to avoid interrupting your workflow:</p><ol><li>Use Alternative Cloud Services: If you cannot use Google Drive at the moment, you have the option to integrate alternative cloud services like Dropbox, OneDrive, or WebDAV-based services in Cryptomator.</li><li>Local Decryption: You can still decrypt your encrypted vaults using the desktop application. If the vault is not that large, you can also download it to your mobile device and decrypt it locally.</li><li>Monitor Updates: We will keep you regularly informed about the progress of our work. As soon as the issue is resolved, we will promptly notify you with the corresponding updates. Keep an eye on our social media accounts on X and Mastodon for updates.</li></ol><h2 id=outlook>Outlook</h2><p>We are confident that we will be able to provide a solution soon. Our goal is to restore full functionality to Cryptomator as quickly as possible. We greatly appreciate your patience and understanding during this time.</p><p>Once again, thank you for your support and trust in Cryptomator. We are working tirelessly to provide you with the best possible experience with our app, and we will keep you informed as soon as there are any updates.</p><p>Best regards,<br>The Cryptomator Team</p><h2 id=faq-google-oauth-issues-in-cryptomator-for-android-and-ios>FAQ: Google OAuth Issues in Cryptomator for Android and iOS</h2><p><strong>Q1: What is the issue with Google Drive and Cryptomator for Android and iOS?</strong><br><strong>A1:</strong> Users are experiencing issues with Google blocking access to your files when using Cryptomator for Android and iOS during the sign-in process.</p><p><strong>Q2: How can I access my files? Is there a workaround?</strong><br><strong>A2:</strong> You can always access your files on your Desktop computer or by copying your vault from your Google Drive to your phone&rsquo;s harddrive and then using Cryptomator for Android and iOS to access them locally.</p><p><strong>Q3: Are my files safe? Is my account safe?</strong><br><strong>A3:</strong> Yes. Your files and account both are safe and at no risk of being deleted or accessed by malicious actors. They are not any less safe than they were a week ago.
Also your files are still encrypted.</p><p><strong>Q4: Is there a problem with my Google account?</strong><br><strong>A4:</strong> No. This is not a problem with your Google account and this should affect all users of Cryptomator for Android and iOS and Google Drive.</p><p><strong>Q5: Is Cryptomator for Android and iOS safe?</strong><br><strong>A5:</strong> Yes. Cryptomator for Android is safe and we are currently not aware of any security issues.
Also see <strong>Q7.</strong></p><p><strong>Q6: Which &ldquo;sensitive info&rdquo; is Cryptomator for Android and iOS trying to access?</strong><br><strong>A6:</strong> To allow access to the files you have stored in Google Drive and to enable the associated functionality, the Cryptomator app needs access to your Google Drive.
Even if the message from Google sounds scary, this is nothing new and nothing to worry about.
Also see <strong>Q7.</strong></p><p><strong>Q7: Why is this happening? Why is Google blocking Cryptomator for Android and iOS?</strong><br><strong>A7:</strong> To enable access to your files stored in Google Drive, Cryptomator needs both your permission and Google&rsquo;s consent. Google has recently adopted newer and stricter security policies that we must adhere to in order to continue to provide access to your Google Drive in the app. If we don&rsquo;t prove to Google in time that we comply with these guidelines, access will be blocked, which is what is happening right now. We are currently in the middle of this verification process to regain access, but this is quite time-consuming and labor-intensive, all of which has led to this situation.</p><p><strong>Q8: What about Cryptomator for Desktop?</strong><br><strong>A8:</strong> The affected functionality is not offered by Cryptomator for Desktop, so there currently is no problem there.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator 1.8.0 for Android</h2><p>As you may have already noticed, we released Cryptomator 1.8.0 for Android last month! It contains a lot of internal changes, a bunch of new features, and some bug fixes.</p><p>This release took quite some time, but we finally made it. &#x1f389; In addition to the <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/android/releases/tag/1.8.0>release notes</a>, we&rsquo;d like to give you more details about some changes.</p><h2 id=material-3-design>Material 3 Design</h2><p>The most obvious change in this release is the migration to Material 3, which modernizes the user interface.</p><h2 id=cryptomator-lite-reproducible-build-and-f-droid>Cryptomator Lite: Reproducible Build and F-Droid</h2><p>A less obvious change is that we now offer a new flavor: Cryptomator Lite.</p><p>This version is built using a reproducible build technique, which has two advantages: You as a user can verify that the published source code matches the published binary, which in turn means that we didn&rsquo;t and couldn&rsquo;t add anything during build time.</p><p>The other advantage is that this technique allows us to publish our app to stores like the main F-Droid repository, but sign it with our keys, which means we still have control over the signing keys.</p><p>Cryptomator Lite can be built using the following Docker image and then compared to the corresponding releases: <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/android/blob/main/buildsystem/Dockerfile>https://github.com/cryptomator/android/blob/main/buildsystem/Dockerfile</a></p><h2 id=aes-gcm-new-default-for-content-encryption>AES-GCM: New Default for Content Encryption</h2><p>Starting with Cryptomator 1.8.0 for Android, we will follow our Desktop application: All newly created vaults will use <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode>AES-GCM</a> instead of AES-CTR+HMAC for file content encryption.</p><p>You can continue to use your existing vaults as before, no action is required on your part.

With this roadmap, we want to give you an overview of what has changed in Cryptomator and what you can look forward to in the coming months.</p><h2 id=ios-version>iOS Version</h2><p>At the end of last year, we were finally able to introduce our new iOS app. One of the main features is the full integration with Apple&rsquo;s own Files app. We also made it possible to offer you a &ldquo;freemium&rdquo; version of the app. If you want to know even more about the new features, check out this <a href=https://cryptomator.org/blog/2021/12/21/ios-2.0/>blog post</a>. Since then, we&rsquo;ve been working on bringing you more features through several updates, such as the auto-lock feature that came with version 2.1.0. With the just released version 2.2.0, we integrated pCloud and added support for shortcuts in Google Drive.</p><p>We have a lot more planned for the app in the coming months. We will integrate Cryptomator into <a href=https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios>Shortcuts</a> so that automation processes such as &ldquo;auto photo upload&rdquo; are possible. We also plan to integrate S3, as we did with our Android app.</p><h2 id=android-version>Android Version</h2><p>Over the past few months, we have been working on increasing the compatibility of Cryptomator. This includes the fact that we now support pCloud, S3, and Vault Format 8. Thanks again Manuel (mjenny on GitHub) for contributing support for pCloud and S3. Also, Cryptomator can now be installed and updated via F-Droid. Vaults in Google Drive can now be used via shortcuts in locations outside of &ldquo;My Drive&rdquo;. This works in &ldquo;Shared with Me&rdquo;, &ldquo;My Computer&rdquo;, and &ldquo;My Drive&rdquo; for example. With OneDrive, it is possible to use multiple accounts at the same time. We will make this feature available for Dropbox and Google Drive in the future. In addition, a &ldquo;real&rdquo; auto photo upload is available in the Android version, meaning new pictures and videos are now uploaded not only after unlocking the vault, but directly when it is unlocked.</p><p>In the coming months, we will switch the Android app to a freemium model, as we did with iOS, and continue to work on the long-awaited document provider.</p><h2 id=desktop-version>Desktop Version</h2><p>With version 1.6.0 announced in the last roadmap, we introduced Vault Format 8 for our Desktop version. You can read more about it <a href=https://cryptomator.org/blog/2021/10/11/vault-format-8/>here</a>. For better usability, we have introduced error codes and a <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/discussions/categories/errors>knowledge base</a> of those, where you can look up solutions for the issue you‚Äôve encountered. We also introduced an auto-lock feature that automatically locks the vaults after a self-defined inactivity time as well as a plugin API. The first plugin for Cryptomator is the <a href=https://plugin.purejava.org/>KeePassXC plugin</a> via an open-source contribution by Ralph (purejava on GitHub). Furthermore, we improved our build systems so that applications/installers for all operating systems are automatically built and signed (instead of manually).</p><p>Two years ago, one might remember that we announced to focus our efforts on Flatpak distribution. However, that didn‚Äôt go as planned and progress on it came to a halt‚Ä¶ until recently. Our regular open-source contributor Ralph (purejava on GitHub) once again came to our rescue. And we actually did it! Cryptomator is now <a href=https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.cryptomator.Cryptomator>available on Flathub as a Flatpak app</a>. Again, huge thanks to Ralph for his amazing contribution!</p><p>For the Desktop version of Cryptomator, we have some major topics coming up in the near future. On the one hand, we are working on a major FUSE refactoring. Among other things, this is necessary to be able to offer ARM64 support on Windows and Linux as well. On Apple Silicon Macs, we have already supported this for a few releases. On the other hand, we want to address the open issues related to <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/projects/13>extended attributes</a>. More precisely, we are talking about additional file attributes that enable tagging and fix compatibility issues. Of course, these attributes will be encrypted just like the filename.</p><p>If you read this far, we‚Äôd like to share a secret with you. We are currently working on <a href=https://cryptomator.org/hub/>Cryptomator Hub</a>. That‚Äôs it for now but you‚Äôll definitely hear more about it this year.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Update on the Document Provider Development</h2><p>Hey Community,</p><p>From time to time, we need to adjust our schedule for certain features. We are well aware that the Document Provider is the most-requested feature of the Android app, but despite this fact, we need to temporarily shift our attention to other tasks within this project. This blog post you&rsquo;re reading right now is to keep you, our community, updated and inform you that we are unable to stick to our original plan. Unfortunately, this means that any further development of the Document Provider feature needs to be postponed to the end of this year.</p><h2 id=the-document-provider-feature>The Document Provider Feature</h2><p>As users of our Android app, you know how cumbersome sometimes the work with it is: You open your favourite notes app to quickly jot something down, then notice that you cannot open your to-do list from the app because you store it encrypted with Cryptomator. So you sigh, open the Cryptomator app, unlock your vault, navigate to the to-do list file and open it with the aforementioned notes app. Definitely not the optimal workflow.</p><p>We always strive to provide the same features across all our supported platforms. One of these is a user-friendly integration of the vault into the running OS to easily access content of unlocked vaults. For the desktop systems, this feature was always present and recently we added it in our new iOS app. The last OS, where it is missing is Android. And the way to resolve this, is implementing a Document Provider for our Android app.</p><p>The Document Provider feature creates a virtual access point to an unlocked vault, with the consequence that you can conveniently browse and access a vault‚Äôs content via the standard file browser. Also, any app which supports browsing through Document Providers can directly load files from your unlocked vault without the need to go via Cryptomator‚Äôs app GUI.</p><h2 id=development-status>Development Status</h2><p>The development is tracked in the following ticket of our issue tracker: <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/android/issues/35>https://github.com/cryptomator/android/issues/35</a></p><p>As you can see, the issue is already quite old and got over the time a countable amount of comments. After <a href=https://cryptomator.org/blog/2020/12/23/android-open-source/>publishing the source code</a> of the app at the end of 2020, our plan was to work on this important feature.</p><p>From the technical side, we already determined the parts of code needed to be edited, developed a concept and built a proof of concept (see the linked ticket). The next step would be to actually implement it including rigorous testing.</p><p>Unfortunately, we determined that integrating Document Provider into the existing app would require major architectural changes, therefore requiring a lot of time and resources. We have exciting plans with Cryptomator after our next major release with version 1.6.0 so that we have to delay the development of the Document Provider integration to the end of 2021.</p><p>Meanwhile, maybe you, our community can help us out.</p><h2 id=call-for-contributions>Call for Contributions</h2><p>Cryptomator for Desktop was always open source. Cryptomator for iOS and Android are now open source as well. And as such, we also rely on our community to receive feedback, distribute the app and improve its functionality.</p><p>So, we are always very excited about contributions and are happy to assist, especially when it comes to the Document Provider. &#x1f609;</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator Roadmap Early 2021</h2><p>Development on Cryptomator 1.5.x is coming to an end and we are now working on the next major version 1.6.x. Read more about it in this roadmap!</p><h2 id=state-of-the-desktop-app>State of the Desktop App</h2><p>The update to version 1.6.0 is just around the corner! The release will mainly contain some invisible changes that will allow us to add new features in a timely manner. One of the main points here is to implement a new vault format (Vault Format 8). It makes the integration of <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/projects/8>other authentication methods</a> in the future possible, for example to enable 2FA.</p><p>Another feature is the <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/projects/7>integration of a sanitizer</a>. Until now, a separate program was needed to check the state of your vault and to execute cleanup and restore commands. In the future, this will be possible directly in the Cryptomator user interface.</p><p>In addition, there is now a prototype for the distribution of Cryptomator as a Microsoft Software Installation (.msi), but the implementation still has alpha character. Furthermore, we have updated Cryptomator to JDK 16 with the latest <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.5.14>version 1.5.14</a>, which brings some upstream fixes. Unfortunately, we could not make any progress with regard to Flatpak.</p><h2 id=state-of-the-android-app>State of the Android App</h2><p>As you might have noticed in our blog, we finally published the source code of the app! Apart from that, vault format 8 is also a big topic in our development here.</p><p>Since the update to version 1.5.14 (currently still in a beta version), pCloud is natively supported by Cryptomator. Many thanks to Manu for <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/android/pull/283>his open source contribution</a>! Another small change is that since the update 1.5.13, it is possible to sort the vault list and thus get a better overview of the vaults.</p><p>But that&rsquo;s not all we have planned for the Android app! We are happy to release Cryptomator on F-Droid soon. Also, we hope to be able to include more clouds soon and enable access to content of the vault via third-party apps with a &ldquo;document provider&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=state-of-the-ios-app>State of the iOS App</h2><p>With the introduction of vault format 8, the &ldquo;old&rdquo; iOS app will probably get its last major update to version 1.6.0.</p><p>Meanwhile, work on the &ldquo;new&rdquo; iOS app continues. As announced in the last roadmap, the iOS app will be fully integrated into the Files app. We are already very far along. Nevertheless, we still have some work to do, as we want to offer some features like dark mode or support for multiple accounts from the same cloud provider right from the start.</p><p>We can&rsquo;t promise you an exact release date yet, but we hope we will release a first beta version via TestFlight in the summer.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Open Source: Cryptomator for Android</h2><p>We announced it last month and now we are ready‚Ä¶ our gift to the community for the holidays: Cryptomator for Android is now fully open-source!

Well, actually the changes were in 1.5.9 but we followed it up with a hotfix release. &#x1f601; With the (crazy) year nearing its end, we&rsquo;d like to give you some insight to our roadmap across all platforms for the upcoming months!</p><h2 id=state-of-the-desktop-app>State of the Desktop App</h2><p>With the redesign and full rewrite of the UI in 1.5.0, we established a good foundation for adding further features. There was one former feature that didn&rsquo;t make the cut though, which is now back with the latest version: Vault Statistics. &#x1f389;</p><figure class=text-center><img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src=/img/blog/vault-statistics.png srcset="/img/blog/vault-statistics.png 1x, /img/blog/vault-statistics@2x.png 2x" alt="Vault Statistics in Cryptomator"></figure><p>We didn&rsquo;t stop there! Vault passwords can now also be stored in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KWallet>KWallet</a> on Linux. Huge thanks to Ralph Plawetzki (purejava on GitHub) for his contribution! And last but not least, it is now possible to mount the vault via FUSE on Windows. This is still a beta feature! In order to try it, <a href=http://www.secfs.net/winfsp/>WinFSP</a> needs to be installed. We&rsquo;d love to hear your feedback on this!</p><p>On the distribution front, we didn&rsquo;t quite meet our expectations. So far, we&rsquo;ve been struggling with Flatpak as we just can&rsquo;t convince its sandbox to properly support FUSE drives. But we&rsquo;re not giving up on this!</p><p>Behind the UI, we introduced the <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/integrations-api>integrations-api</a> alongside implementations for each OS. It&rsquo;s a new way for Cryptomator to include native (also OS-specific) functionalities. Now easier than ever, you can implement native functions. So grab your keyboard and start hacking! &#x1f601; With this change, we archived the old <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/native-functions>native-functions</a> repository. &#x1f44b;</p><p>What&rsquo;s next? Our plan is to move on to 1.6.x. First of all, we want to integrate <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/sanitizer>Sanitizer</a>, so you can check your vault health and run cleanup and recovery tasks right within the Cryptomator UI. Furthermore, by decoupling the key derivation from the vault encryption, we plan to give you more options for authentication, including third-party password storage, 2FA, and multi-user access using individual passwords.</p><h2 id=state-of-the-android-app>State of the Android App</h2><p>In the last months, we added new features like <a href=https://community.cryptomator.org/t/biometric-authentication-e-g-face-unlock-coming-soon/6089>face unlock</a>, <a href=https://community.cryptomator.org/t/sort-directory-listings/5958>sort directory listings</a>, and <a href=https://community.cryptomator.org/t/search-in-current-folder-using-glob-pattern-matching/5928>search using glob pattern matching</a>. Some community members also translated the app to <a href=https://community.cryptomator.org/t/translated-into-french/5962>French</a> and <a href=https://community.cryptomator.org/t/cryptomator-is-soon-available-in-turkish/6560>Turkish</a>. Many thanks for their contributions!</p><p>Looking forward, we have some exciting news about our Android app! The project is in the perfect situation to fulfill the two biggest wishes of the community:</p><ol><li>Open Source: Publishing the source code of the app.</li><li>Document Provider: Accessing the content of the vault using third-party apps.</li></ol><p>You heard that right, we are going to open-source Cryptomator for Android! The fact that the app is open-core had its legitimate reasons but we are now fully confident that we can open-source the app without compromises. We are working hard to publish the complete source code within a few weeks.</p><p>After that, the highly anticipated Document Provider feature will be on our roadmap.</p><h2 id=state-of-the-ios-app>State of the iOS App</h2><p>What&rsquo;s up with Cryptomator for iOS? For the last 6-7 months, we have been hard at work on a <em>completely</em> new app written in Swift. Our first efforts can already be seen in our new open-source libraries for Swift: <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptolib-swift>cryptolib-swift</a> and <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cloud-access-swift>cloud-access-swift</a>.</p><p>What will be so special about the rewrite? Cryptomator will be fully integrated into the Files app. This comes with many benefits like thumbnails, support for third-party apps that can edit files directly inside the vault, and many more! But that also means, there won&rsquo;t be a &ldquo;custom&rdquo; file browser inside the app anymore. Integration into the Files app is one of the most requested features of the community.</p><p>What about open source? We won&rsquo;t open-source the current app anymore because we&rsquo;d like to look forward. The new app is written with open-sourcing it in mind but it will still take some time until we can release anything.</p><p>We&rsquo;ll definitely do extensive testing via TestFlight in the next year. Stay tuned for that!</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator for Android for Us Paranoids</h2><p>This blog post is aimed towards the paranoid Cryptomator power users among us and describes how to fully establish a relationship of trust with Cryptomator for Android.</p><p>When it comes to our desktop application, we claim that you should in fact <em>not</em> trust us but you (or at least many developers) can instead <em>inspect</em> what Cryptomator is doing. For our mobile apps, this is only half the truth, frankly. While the encryption code is fully open-source, the UI and cloud access code isn&rsquo;t (yet &#x1f609;).<br>If you count yourself as one of the more paranoid users, who prefer to compile everything yourselves, you might ask the legitimate question: How can you check the current, open-core app for backdoors?</p><p>A backdoor usually requires communication with an external server. If vaults are only opened from the device&rsquo;s file system, the Cryptomator app does not require an internet connection. Alternatively, the vault can be synchronized bidirectionally to the file system of the smartphone with a third-party application such as <a class=text-link href=https://syncthing.net/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Syncthing</a>.</p><p>Using this setup, the Cryptomator app can have its internet access revoked using the Android operating system features, which prevents the app from sending or receiving any data to or from the internet.</p><figure class=text-center><img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src=/img/blog/android-for-paranoids-permission.png alt="Android revoke Cryptomator's internet permission"></figure><p>Thus, even if there ever was a backdoor in Cryptomator for Android, it would not be possible for the intercepted data to leave the smartphone. This is ensured by the operating system.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator 1.5.0 Release</h2><figure class=text-center><img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src=/img/blog/cryptomator-1-5-0.png srcset="/img/blog/cryptomator-1-5-0.png 1x, /img/blog/cryptomator-1-5-0@2x.png 2x" alt="Cryptomator 1.5.0 is now available with a brand-new user interface (incl. dark mode) and an improved vault format"></figure><p>Cryptomator has been redesigned and comes with a new dark mode. It is not simply a redesign, it was a full rewrite of the UI. During the rewrite, a whole new code structure was planned which makes it easier to extend the application in the future. One goal of the redesign was to make the onboarding process easier for users who don&rsquo;t feel too comfortable with encryption software. Usability tests helped designing the workflows and understanding common misconceptions. Besides the redesign, the new vault format 7 increases compatibility with some cloud services and at the same time reduces the complexity for certain I/O operations.</p><p>To support the ongoing open-source development of Cryptomator, consider <a href=/donate/>buying a donation key</a>, which unlocks the new dark mode. &#x2764;&#xfe0f; <a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.5.0 target=_blank rel=noopener>Detailed release notes</a> for the desktop app are available on GitHub.</p><p>As you might have noticed, this website is also shining in a completely new design. &#x2728;</p><h2 id=cryptomator-for-ios--android>Cryptomator for iOS & Android</h2><p>New updates for iOS and Android have been released as well.

While most of you have already noticed that we&rsquo;re approaching a new major release of Cryptomator, I think it is time to inform you where we&rsquo;re currently standing and what our roadmap looks like.</p><h2 id=state-of-our-desktop-application>State of our Desktop Application</h2><p>We plan to release 1.5.0 within Q1 2020. In our currently running beta (huge shout-outs to all the helpful test feedback), we have already sorted out several problems and feel confident to deliver outstanding quality.</p><p>While we have already discussed <a href="https://community.cryptomator.org/t/handling-of-long-filenames-in-cryptomator-1-5-0/4191?u=overheadhunter">upcoming changes</a> to what we call the <em>vault format</em> (i.e. the layout of the encrypted files and directory) to increase compatibility with some cloud services and at the same time reduce the complexity for certain I/O operations, the far more obvious change affects the GUI:</p><p>We did not simply <em>redesign</em> our UI, we did a full <em>rewrite</em> of it. Nearly every single line of code that was involved in Cryptomator 1.4.x has been deleted. Why would you do something like this? Well, the application grew over time. Cryptomator has been started more than six years ago and some concepts weren&rsquo;t established back then that make development easier today. During the rewrite, we planned a whole new code structure which makes it easier to extend the application in the future and at the same time have new developers understand what parts of the code is responsible for what dialog in the software.</p><p>One goal of the redesign was to make the onboarding process easier for users who don&rsquo;t feel too comfortable with encryption software. We attended (and organized) some usability tests in our vicinity and saw how first-time users reacted to the vault creation process. This helped us to design the workflows and understand common misconceptions.</p><h2 id=state-of-the-android-app>State of the Android App</h2><p>Not worth mentioning is that the Android app in 1.5.0 will support vault format 7. In the Android app, we focused on implementing new features and improving stability:</p><ul><li>Already opened files are cached on the smartphone. When reopened and if the file has not changed in the cloud, the file is loaded from the local file system, which leads to a huge performance improvement.</li><li>Fixed and improved auto photo upload e.g., after device reboot or on Android 10 under certain conditions the upload didn‚Äôt work</li><li>We added an option to lock a vault immediately when Cryptomator is closed or in background</li><li>Last but not least, we&rsquo;ve put a lot of work into a new license store that will enable us to provide an alternative way of distributing our Android app, as we have a lot of requests from users who prefer not to use Google services such as the Play Store</li></ul><h2 id=state-of-the-ios-app>State of the iOS App</h2><p>The iOS app will also support vault format 7, obviously. There are some further fixes and improvements under the hood, but no new features. It already supports caching and it you can even buy it without using the Google Play Store. &#x1f609;</p><h2 id=what-is-missing-for-the-final-release-of-150>What is missing for the final release of 1.5.0?</h2><p>While at the time of writing this, there are only few missing features planned for 1.5.0 (such as vault recovery) and only some final polishing is required from our side, we want to make sure our mobile apps and also third party apps such as Cyberduck are ready to deal with the new vault format, too. For some bugs scheduled for 1.5.0 (such as <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/986>this one</a>), we&rsquo;re currently waiting for an upstream fix.</p><p>Simultaneously, we&rsquo;re preparing new documentation pages for 1.5.0 as well as a new website with a new FAQ section and we integrate <a href="https://community.cryptomator.org/t/localization-of-cryptomator-1-5-0/4269?u=overheadhunter">new translations</a> added by our great community on a regular basis.</p><h2 id=whats-up-next>What&rsquo;s up next?</h2><p>Our first priority right after 1.5.0 is to migrate from Java 11 to Java 14. Java 14 includes a long-awaited new tool that is required for our packaging. We&rsquo;re currently using a workaround that prevents us from upgrading to the latest bundled JRE. This is a small change that will probably be shipped right with 1.5.1. However, we didn&rsquo;t want to dig up new holes right before 1.5.0 and decided to postpone this to 1.5.1.</p><p>Next, we want to focus on Flatpak. We ditched <code>.deb</code> and <code>.rpm</code> files some time ago and replaced them with AppImages. We also really like how the Flatpak ecosystem is gaining traction and is supported natively by a steadily increasing number of distributions. So far, <a href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/729>we didn&rsquo;t get Cryptomator working</a> due to the complexity behind the file system mounts. But after we&rsquo;ve finished 1.5.0, we hope to be able to put some more attention to this and solve this to ship Cryptomator as a Flatpak soon.</p><p>In the Android app, the next big feature will be accessing files of a Cryptomator vault inside other apps using a DocumentProvider. For example, a file explorer will be able to access the content of the vault in this way. As well as smaller features like recursive upload of folders to the vault are planned.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator Roadmap Mid 2019</h2><p>We would like to take a more regular look at our roadmap to publicly document the past, present, and future developments of Cryptomator. Unlike before, we&rsquo;re also going to have a look at the roadmaps of our mobile apps.</p><h2 id=desktop>Desktop</h2><p>In the desktop area, we are currently pursuing two different branches: On the one hand we are striving for feature completion of 1.4.x, with 1.4.12 already available as a release candidate. It will finally allow Linux users to store their password in the system and include the much desired &ldquo;Custom Mount Flags&rdquo; feature.</p><ul><li><strong>Save password in system (Linux):</strong> For a long time, you could only store your vault&rsquo;s password in the system under macOS and Windows. Through a community contribution, this is now finally also possible under (some) Linux systems. &#x1f604; The existence of GNOME Keyring or another keychain via Secret Service API is required. Many thanks to Ralph Plawetzki (purejava on GitHub) and Sebastian Wiesendahl (swiesend on GitHub) for the implementation!</li><li><strong>Custom Mount Flags:</strong> Cryptomator uses default options to mount a drive (both for Dokany and FUSE) that we chose for security or performance reasons. However, this leads to limited functionality in some cases and users who want to set their own options can now change them. Be aware: <em>Use at your own risk!</em></li></ul><p>On the other hand the implementation of 1.5.0 has already started. For 1.5.0, as announced, we want to fully concentrate on the redesign of the user interface and improve the internal processing of Cryptomator, because like many open-source projects it has grown organically over time and therefore needs a good refactoring. &#x1f609;</p><h2 id=ios>iOS</h2><p>After the release of Cryptomator 1.4.0 for iOS with built-in cache functionality, which on the one hand avoids repeated downloading of files and on the other hand allows (limited) offline access, the work on Cryptomator 1.5.0 for iOS has started.</p><p>The main focus will be the integration into the Files app of iOS. The first step will be the expansion of our <a class=text-link href=https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/FileProvider.html target=_blank rel=noopener>Document Provider</a> which is going to be extended by the methods &ldquo;Open&rdquo; and &ldquo;Move&rdquo;. This will make a direct access to files within a Cryptomator vault from other apps possible without having to copy them back and forth.</p><h2 id=android>Android</h2><p>Cryptomator 1.4.0 for Android is currently being finalized with the following features, which can already be tested in a beta version:</p><ul><li><strong>Automatic photo upload:</strong> After activation, all images created on the smartphone will be uploaded the next time the selected vault is unlocked.</li><li><strong>Make files writable by third-party apps:</strong> Files that are opened can be edited in third-party apps. When you finish the editing process by saving and returning to the Cryptomator app, the changes are transferred to the cloud.</li></ul><p>We are considering these features for future versions:</p><ul><li><strong>LRU Cache:</strong> To save network traffic, certain server responses are cached to avoid repeated downloading, for example of unmodified images from the cloud.</li><li><strong>Support for Google Team Drives:</strong> Access to vaults located in Google Team Drive should be made possible.</li><li><strong>Distribution of the app outside of Google Play:</strong> Cryptomator for Android should also be available from alternative sources. We are thinking about setting up a licensing system, through which a license could be purchased directly.</li><li><strong>Unlocking with system password:</strong> You should be able to use the system password of the smartphone to open vaults. (Similar to unlocking with a fingerprint.)</li><li><strong>Access to files via DocumentProvider:</strong> Access to a Cryptomator vault inside other apps should be made possible via a DocumentProvider. For example, a file explorer would then be able to access the vault in this way.</li><li><strong>Upload of directories (recursive):</strong> The download of whole folders already works, the upload including all subfolders is not possible yet.</li></ul></article><article class="prose prose-sm md:prose max-w-none md:max-w-none"><h2>Cryptomator 1.0 for Android Release</h2><p>Today, we are glad to announce the release of Cryptomator 1.0 for Android. &#x1f389; Finally, you can protect your cloud files also on Android devices. The app is naturally fully compatible to the desktop and iOS versions of Cryptomator.</p><p>We have worked extensively during the last year to ensure the app&rsquo;s security and usability. Thanks to your feedback and the experiences of more than 10,000 beta testers, the Android app has finally reached the level of maturity that fulfills Cryptomator&rsquo;s high standards.</p><p>In version 1.0 for Android, the app is compatible with Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, and WebDAV-based providers. You can also create vaults in Android&rsquo;s local storage and, e.g., sync them with third-party apps.

We tried hosting the virtual drive via <code>localhost</code>, <code>127.0.0.1</code>, and <code>::1</code> but every host has its own issue: Sometimes access to the virtual drive was extremely slow, sometimes Windows showed unnecessary security warnings (<a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/529 target=_blank rel=noopener>#529</a>), and sometimes Office didn&rsquo;t properly work (<a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/512 target=_blank rel=noopener>#512</a>). That&rsquo;s why the Windows installer for Cryptomator now writes the new host <code>cryptomator-vault</code> (which is mapped to <code>127.0.0.1</code>) into the <code>hosts</code> file. Weirdly enough, with that new host, all problems seem to be gone. Even though we don&rsquo;t quite understand why binding an IP has such a big impact, we just hope that we finally found a good solution!</p><h3 id=under-the-hood-improvements>Under-The-Hood Improvements</h3><p>We&rsquo;d like to highlight some improvements that we were able to make under-the-hood: Faster build times, high test coverage for our crypto libraries, and more!</p><h4 id=ci-build-times>CI Build Times</h4><p>(<a class=text-link href=https://travis-ci.org/cryptomator/cryptomator/builds target=_blank rel=noopener>Travis CI build numbers are in parentheses</a>)</p><table class="table-fixed w-full"><thead><tr class=border-t><th class="w-1/3 px-4 py-2">Branch</th><th class="w-1/3 px-4 py-2">1.3.0</th><th class="w-1/3 px-4 py-2">1.2.4</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">Master (Release)</th><td class="px-4 py-2">3min (809, 819, 835, 842, 845)</td><td class="px-4 py-2">5min (699, 704, 714, 727, 828)</td></tr><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">Develop</th><td class="px-4 py-2">1.6min (830, 831, 837, 839, 841)</td><td class="px-4 py-2">3min (710, 711, 715, 724, 725)</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id=lines-of-code>Lines of Code</h4><p>(determined via <code>cloc --exclude-dir=test --include-lang=Java</code>)</p><table class="table-fixed w-full"><thead><tr class=border-t><th class="w-1/3 px-4 py-2">Project</th><th class="w-1/3 px-4 py-2">1.3.0</th><th class="w-1/3 px-4 py-2">1.2.4</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">Cryptomator-Desktop</th><td class="px-4 py-2">7,249</td><td class="px-4 py-2">16,624</td></tr><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">CryptoLib</th><td class="px-4 py-2">1,447</td><td class="px-4 py-2">-</td></tr><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">CryptoFS</th><td class="px-4 py-2">6,829</td><td class="px-4 py-2">-</td></tr><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">WebDAV-NIO-Adapter</th><td class="px-4 py-2">3,979</td><td class="px-4 py-2">-</td></tr><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">SIV-Mode</th><td class="px-4 py-2">1,238</td><td class="px-4 py-2">1,238</td></tr><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">Sum</th><td class="px-4 py-2">20,742</td><td class="px-4 py-2">17,862</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id=test-coverage>Test Coverage</h4><p>(determined via JaCoCo)</p><table class="table-fixed w-full"><thead><tr class=border-t><th class="w-1/3 px-4 py-2">Project</th><th class="w-1/3 px-4 py-2">1.3.0</th><th class="w-1/3 px-4 py-2">1.2.4</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">Cryptomator-Desktop</th><td class="px-4 py-2">14%</td><td class="px-4 py-2">66%</td></tr><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">CryptoLib</th><td class="px-4 py-2">93%</td><td class="px-4 py-2">-</td></tr><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">CryptoFS</th><td class="px-4 py-2">97%</td><td class="px-4 py-2">-</td></tr><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">WebDAV-NIO-Adapter</th><td class="px-4 py-2">26%</td><td class="px-4 py-2">-</td></tr><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">SIV-Mode</th><td class="px-4 py-2">96%</td><td class="px-4 py-2">96%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>* passes <a class=text-link href=http://www.webdav.org/neon/litmus/ target=_blank rel=noopener>litmus (WebDAV server test suite)</a></p><h4 id=file-size>File Size</h4><table class="table-fixed w-full"><thead><tr class=border-t><th class="w-1/3 px-4 py-2">File</th><th class="w-1/3 px-4 py-2">1.3.0</th><th class="w-1/3 px-4 py-2">1.2.4</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=border-t><th class="px-4 py-2">Cryptomator.jar</th><td class="px-4 py-2">9.18 MB</td><td class="px-4 py-2">12.1 MB</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=evolution-of-cryptomator>Evolution of Cryptomator</h3><p>(made with Gource)</p><div class="relative aspect-video"><iframe class="absolute w-full h-full" src=https://gfycat.com/ifr/UnlawfulAdmirableAmericanindianhorse frameborder=0 scrolling=no allowfullscreen></iframe></div><hr><h2 id=cryptomator-124-for-ios>Cryptomator 1.2.4 for iOS</h2><ul><li>Added compatibility to vault version 6</li><li>Fixed auto-lock bug, which occurred when you opened up the Touch ID settings (<a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-ios/issues/89 target=_blank rel=noopener>#89</a>)</li><li>Improved filename blacklist, you can now see files and folders that start with a period &ldquo;.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>We weren&rsquo;t able to finish <a class=text-link href=https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-ios/milestone/11 target=_blank rel=noopener>Cryptomator 1.3.0 for iOS</a> in time.
