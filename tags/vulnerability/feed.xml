The occasion is &lt;strong>Digital Independence Day&lt;/strong> — a day of action for digital self-determination, privacy, and independence from tech monopolies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what does &lt;strong>digital independence&lt;/strong> actually mean? And more importantly: How can you take your first steps without completely changing your digital everyday life or investing a lot of time and energy?&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="text-center">

&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-digital-independence-day">What Is Digital Independence Day?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Digital Independence Day is an initiative that encourages people to &lt;strong>reduce their dependence on large, centralized tech platforms&lt;/strong> — especially those whose business models are based on data collection, lock-in effects, and a lack of transparency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of calling for radical change, the movement deliberately focuses on &lt;strong>small, practical steps&lt;/strong> that are accessible to everyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the &lt;strong>official &lt;a href="https://di.day/">Digital Independence Day&lt;/a> website&lt;/strong>, you’ll find ideas, tools, and easy guides to help you get started right away — from communication and social media to cloud storage and online services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At its core, Digital Independence Day stands for:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>less dependence&lt;/strong> on tech monopolies&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>more control&lt;/strong> over your own data&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>conscious use&lt;/strong> of privacy-friendly alternatives&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="why-digital-independence-matters">Why Digital Independence Matters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Today, much of our digital lives takes place on just a few platforms. They store our documents, organize our communication, and influence which information we see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This &lt;strong>concentration of power&lt;/strong> has consequences:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>loss of data sovereignty&lt;/li>
&lt;li>opaque data usage and profiling&lt;/li>
&lt;li>limited freedom of choice&lt;/li>
&lt;li>political and economic dependencies&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Digital independence &lt;strong>does not mean rejecting technology&lt;/strong>. It means &lt;strong>regaining agency&lt;/strong> and using tools that respect users, promote openness, and enable real control over data.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="digital-independence-doesnt-have-to-be-complicated">Digital Independence Doesn’t Have to Be Complicated&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There is a common assumption that digital independence requires technical expertise or hours of research. In reality, many impactful steps can be taken &lt;strong>in just a few minutes&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are a few examples inspired by Digital Independence Day:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. Try decentralized social networks&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of relying on a centralized platform like Facebook or X, you can try decentralized networks such as &lt;strong>Mastodon&lt;/strong>. Mastodon works similarly to traditional social networks, but it is not controlled by a single company. You can choose a provider, switch if needed, and still stay connected to the entire network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The official &lt;a href="https://di.day/category/rezepte/">Digital Independence Day&lt;/a> website offers easy starting points and explanations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2. Be more conscious about cloud storage&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cloud services are convenient, but they often mean that &lt;strong>unencrypted data is stored with third-party providers&lt;/strong>. A simple first step toward digital independence is &lt;strong>client-side encryption&lt;/strong>: your files are encrypted before they leave your device. This is exactly where &lt;strong>Cryptomator&lt;/strong> comes in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Cryptomator, you can continue using your existing cloud provider &lt;strong>while staying in control of your data&lt;/strong>. The provider stores only encrypted files — the keys remain with you. No provider switch. No complicated setup. But significantly more control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>3. Replace one tool at a time&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You don’t have to change everything at once. Instead, start by &lt;strong>focusing on one area&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>messaging&lt;/li>
&lt;li>cloud storage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>social media&lt;/li>
&lt;li>password management&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Replace just one tool with a more &lt;strong>privacy-friendly alternative&lt;/strong>. That alone is already a meaningful step. &lt;strong>Digital independence is a process&lt;/strong> — not a to-do list. That’s why Digital Independence Day focuses on small actions that anyone can easily take in everyday life.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-we-support-digital-independence-day">Why We Support Digital Independence Day&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At Cryptomator, we believe that &lt;strong>privacy and control should not be a luxury&lt;/strong>. They should be the standard and accessible to everyone. Digital Independence Day aligns perfectly with this belief. It empowers people to make informed decisions without pressure and without fear-mongering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s why we support the initiative and invite our community to take part — not just for one day, but continuously.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="digital-independence-day-special--february-edition">Digital Independence Day Special — February Edition&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To support your first (or next) step toward digital independence, we’re continuing our campaign: On the &lt;strong>first Sunday of February&lt;/strong>, we’re giving away &lt;strong>100 Cryptomator voucher codes — for free&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The codes will be shared on our social media channels and are available on a &lt;strong>first come, first served&lt;/strong> basis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our goal: to lower the barrier to entry and make digital self-determination accessible to as many people as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="your-next-step">Your Next Step&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Digital independence doesn’t require perfection. It starts with awareness and grows with every conscious decision.

In doing so, they process &lt;strong>particularly sensitive data&lt;/strong> on a daily basis: personal complaints, election results, meeting minutes, or confidential agreements with trade unions. All of this information is not only subject to a &lt;strong>moral obligation of confidentiality&lt;/strong>—it also falls under the strict requirements of the &lt;a href="https://staging.cryptomator.org/compliance/gdpr/">&lt;strong>GDPR&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But how can a works council fulfill this responsibility in the digital age, when documents are often stored, shared, and edited collaboratively in the cloud? The answer lies in a combination of &lt;strong>technical security, organizational processes&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>the right tools&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="text-center">
&lt;img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src="https://staging.cryptomator.org/img/blog/encryption-for-works-councils.png" alt="Why Works Councils Need Encryption More Than Ever" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="sensitive-data-requires-special-protective-measures">Sensitive Data Requires Special Protective Measures&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Personnel data, sick notes, conflict discussions, internal processes—&lt;strong>works councils have deep insights into the innermost workings of the company&lt;/strong>. This information concerns not only labor law disputes or restructuring, but also very personal situations in the lives of employees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The GDPR requires such personal data to be protected with appropriate technical and organizational measures. This explicitly includes &lt;strong>encryption&lt;/strong>. This measure is not an optional extra, but a &lt;strong>central component of works council work&lt;/strong> that complies with data protection regulations.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-encryption-is-not-always-the-same">Why Encryption Is Not Always the Same&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Many companies today already rely on &lt;strong>cloud-based systems such as Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace&lt;/strong>. These solutions advertise built-in security and encryption. However, what many people don&amp;rsquo;t know is that this often involves &lt;strong>server-side encryption&lt;/strong>, which means that although the data is encrypted, the provider or administrator has the keys. Anyone who has access to the system can also access the data. This applies in particular to internal company administrators or external service providers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is not sufficient for particularly sensitive information, such as that processed by works councils. &lt;strong>End-to-end encryption&lt;/strong> is required here: only authorized persons can access the content – even cloud providers or central IT departments have no access. The key to access remains exclusively with the works council.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="digital-sovereignty-with-cryptomator-hub">Digital Sovereignty With Cryptomator Hub&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://staging.cryptomator.org/for-teams/">&lt;strong>Cryptomator Hub&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> provides works councils with a tool that meets precisely these requirements. The solution enables the creation of encrypted data rooms (known as vaults) that can be used on any common cloud platform – while &lt;strong>remaining entirely under the control of the council&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Vaults can be structured according to topics, roles, or working groups&lt;/strong> – for example, for minutes, election documents, complaints, or legal advice. &lt;strong>Access rights can be assigned granularly&lt;/strong> via a clear interface. For example, only the election committee is authorized to access election documents, while other members have access to general meeting minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another advantage: the &lt;strong>Web of Trust&lt;/strong> principle allows the committee to integrate new devices and members on a trust basis – &lt;strong>without any central IT management or external administration&lt;/strong>. This is how digital self-administration becomes a reality.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="integration-without-it-dependency">Integration Without IT Dependency&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A &lt;strong>common obstacle&lt;/strong> for works councils is their &lt;strong>dependence on their employer&amp;rsquo;s IT infrastructure&lt;/strong>. What if the company itself provides the cloud platform? Or what if the works council does not operate its own technical infrastructure?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cryptomator Hub works independently of the underlying cloud&lt;/strong>. This means that even if the company provides Dropbox, OneDrive, or Nextcloud, the works council can securely encrypt its content without the employer having access. &lt;strong>Control over the key and access structure remains exclusively with the committee&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It can also be used on &lt;strong>private devices&lt;/strong>, which is an important factor for smaller works councils or committees without their own office infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Confidentiality is not a nice-to-have, but a legal obligation and a responsibility that must be upheld. Works councils facing digital transformation &lt;strong>should view the protection of sensitive data as a key requirement&lt;/strong>—not only to comply with legal requirements, but also to maintain the trust of the workforce.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With end-to-end encryption and independent tools such as Cryptomator Hub, works councils can fulfill this obligation &lt;strong>securely, easily, and independently&lt;/strong>. And in doing so, they can send an important message: for digital maturity, for data protection, and for modern co-determination on an equal footing.&lt;/p></description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/11/24/encryption-for-works-councils/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/11/24/encryption-for-works-councils/</guid><category>cryptomator</category><category>hub</category></item><item><title>Cryptomator Desktop 1.18.0 is here!</title><description>&lt;p>We are pleased to announce the &lt;strong>official release of Cryptomator Desktop version 1.18.0&lt;/strong>. Following the &lt;a href="https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/09/26/desktop-beta-1.18.0/">beta phase&lt;/a>, this version brings the full package of improvements, new features, and stability enhancements—now available for all supported platforms.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="text-center">

&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="new-features-whats-new-in-1180">New Features: What’s New in 1.18.0?&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="restoring-the-vault-configuration-file">Restoring the Vault Configuration File&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>recovery key&lt;/strong> has been part of Cryptomator for some time, but with version 1.18.0, it is now significantly more powerful: You can now &lt;strong>completely restore lost or damaged master key files and vault configuration files&lt;/strong> using your existing recovery key.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whether accidentally deleted, overwritten due to a backup problem, or damaged by a memory error, the vault can now be &lt;strong>reliably reconstructed&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This makes the recovery key a real emergency tool that secures access to the vault in case of an emergency and prevents complete data loss.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="text-center">
&lt;img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src="https://staging.cryptomator.org/img/blog/recover-vault-config.png" srcset="https://staging.cryptomator.org/img/blog/recover-vault-config.png 1x, https://staging.cryptomator.org/img/blog/recover-vault-config@2x.png 2x" alt="Restoring the vault configuration file" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h3 id="new-signature-certificates-for-windows">New Signature Certificates for Windows&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Windows installer and all binary files are &lt;strong>signed with a new certificate&lt;/strong>. The old certificate is no longer valid, and the new certificate ensures smooth installation on modern Windows systems without disruptive warning dialogs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="remembering-the-last-vault-location">Remembering the Last Vault Location&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When creating a new vault, Cryptomator now automatically suggests the &lt;strong>last location used&lt;/strong>. Users who create multiple vaults in similar folder structures benefit from a &lt;strong>significantly faster setup process&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="bug-fixes--platform-improvements">Bug Fixes &amp;amp; Platform Improvements&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="macos-26-correct-display-of-the-app-icon--and-no-squircle-jail-for-cryptomator">macOS 26: Correct Display of the App Icon – And No &amp;ldquo;Squircle Jail&amp;rdquo; for Cryptomator&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>On macOS 26 (codename &amp;ldquo;Tahoe&amp;rdquo;), the &lt;strong>Cryptomator icon&lt;/strong> was put inside a generic grey squircle, which didn&amp;rsquo;t look right. This issue has been fixed in version 1.18.0, so the icon now appears as it should.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Tahoe, Apple now enforces squircle-shaped icons for all macOS apps—similar to the strict guidelines that have always applied to iOS. Previously, macOS apps could escape the squircle more freely, and many apps used this playfully as part of their visual identity. But now, app icons must conform to the squircle shape. We&amp;rsquo;re joining the &lt;strong>squircle resistance&lt;/strong> alongside other app developers who are keeping their distinctive icon designs instead of conforming to this new guideline.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="text-center">

&lt;/figure>
&lt;h3 id="macfuse-detection-on-macos-26">macFUSE Detection on macOS 26&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Some users experienced problems integrating vaults because macFUSE was not always recognized on macOS 26. This bug has now been fixed, so vaults can be opened reliably again.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="windows-control-over-log-file-sizes">Windows: Control Over Log File Sizes&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In rare cases, log files on Windows could grow enormously and cause system problems. The size limit of the log files has been corrected so that Cryptomator runs reliably and conserves resources in the background again.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="linuxkde-cleaning-up-quickaccess-entries">Linux/KDE: Cleaning Up QuickAccess Entries&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Under KDE, the Dolphin file manager created a new QuickAccess entry every time a vault was unlocked—even if one already existed, for example after the app was unexpectedly closed. This behavior has now been corrected. Existing entries are reused, and unnecessary duplications are a thing of the past.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="further-changes--technical-updates">Further Changes &amp;amp; Technical Updates&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Update of the UI framework to JavaFX 25&lt;/strong>: improved performance, modern graphics display, and long-term compatibility.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>New “Share” entry in the context menu&lt;/strong> that explains how to share vaults.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Various &lt;strong>security and library updates&lt;/strong> (including nimbus-jose-jwt, logback, commons-lang3, dagger) to keep the software up to date and secure.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="why-this-update-is-important">Why This Update Is Important&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Version 1.18.0 makes Cryptomator Desktop &lt;strong>more robust, user-friendly, and better prepared for future operating system versions&lt;/strong>. The new recovery feature protects in critical scenarios (e.g., damaged configuration files), while UI and system improvements make everyday use of Cryptomator smoother.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-you-can-do-now">What You Can Do Now&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Install Cryptomator Desktop 1.18.0 for your operating system.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you have been using the &lt;strong>beta version&lt;/strong>, please be sure to update to the final release!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For businesses and security-conscious users, it&amp;rsquo;s worth taking a look at the &lt;strong>new Windows certificate&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And remember: &lt;strong>keep your vault recovery key safe&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="closing-remarks">Closing Remarks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Thank you&lt;/strong> to everyone in the community who tested the beta. Your &lt;strong>feedback&lt;/strong> directly contributed to making 1.18.0 a strong, stable release. With this update, Cryptomator Desktop is more reliable than ever!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On this anniversary, we look back on two exciting years full of further developments, beta features, new areas of application—and what&amp;rsquo;s yet to come.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="text-center">
&lt;img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src="https://staging.cryptomator.org/img/blog/hub-anniversary-2025.png" alt="Two Years of Cryptomator Hub – Team Encryption Reimagined" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-cryptomator-hub">What is Cryptomator Hub?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cryptomator Hub is the &lt;strong>central platform for managing and sharing encrypted vaults&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the classic Cryptomator app allows individuals to protect their cloud files, the Hub extends this principle to teams and organizations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cryptomator Hub offers a web-based dashboard that administrators and team members can use to &lt;strong>manage users, assign roles, and control access rights&lt;/strong>—all fully encrypted and GDPR-compliant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cryptomator Hub thus bridges the gap between strong &lt;strong>end-to-end encryption&lt;/strong> and user-friendly teamwork.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="features-that-make-the-difference">Features That Make the Difference&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Centralized Management of Users and Permissions&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a small team or a large organization, administrators can always keep track of who has access to which vaults. Role-based permissions make management easy and transparent.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Web of Trust&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
This security model enables secure key exchange between team members via digital trust relationships. No unencrypted data exchange and no complicated key files, as trust is mapped technically.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Create Vault Role&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Teams can independently create new vaults without administrators having to accompany each step. This keeps collaboration flexible while maintaining a high level of security.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Self-Hosting &amp;amp; Data Protection by Design&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Data protection is not an add-on, but a core principle: Cryptomator Hub can be operated locally (on-prem) or in private cloud environments. This gives companies and institutions complete control over their infrastructure and data.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Integration with Popular Cloud Services&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Whether OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, or Nextcloud, Cryptomator Hub integrates seamlessly into existing work environments and protects data regardless of the provider.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="typical-areas-of-application">Typical Areas of Application&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="companies-and-public-authorities">Companies and Public Authorities&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Companies use Cryptomator Hub to implement zero-trust security strategies. &lt;strong>Industries with high compliance requirements&lt;/strong>—such as healthcare, public administration, and legal services—benefit particularly from GDPR-compliant cloud encryption.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Companies such as &lt;a href="">Walbusch GmbH &amp;amp; Co. KG&lt;/a> are already successfully using Cryptomator Hub and can report consistently positive results:&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="two-years-of-further-development--and-looking-to-the-future">Two Years of Further Development – And Looking to the Future&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Since its launch in 2023, Cryptomator Hub has developed rapidly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/04/15/hub-1.4.0/">1.4.0 update&lt;/a> in April 2025 brought two decisive milestones with the &lt;strong>Web of Trust&lt;/strong> and the &lt;strong>Create Vault role&lt;/strong>. Furthermore, everything is focused on optimization, scaling, and future-proofing—especially with regard to the upcoming standards of &lt;a href="https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/07/24/post-quantum-roadmap/">post-quantum cryptography&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But we are not resting on our laurels. &lt;strong>Three new features&lt;/strong> are already in the pipeline to make Cryptomator Hub even more powerful and user-friendly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="usergroup-management">User/Group Management&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>User and group management&lt;/strong> will become much more convenient in the future. With the new, &lt;strong>integrated user/group management&lt;/strong>, smaller companies and organizations can create and manage their team structures directly in the hub—intuitively, clearly, and without detours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the background, we continue to rely on &lt;strong>Keycloak&lt;/strong>—a proven, powerful solution for identity and access management.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;h3 id="emergency-access">Emergency Access&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In companies, it can always happen that employees leave and access to important data is lost as a result.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The upcoming &lt;strong>Emergency Access&lt;/strong> feature provides a remedy here: it allows you to &lt;strong>designate a specific group of authorized persons&lt;/strong> who can restore access to a vault, either collectively or partially, in an emergency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Even in critical situations or in the event of personnel changes&lt;/strong>, the company remains capable of acting.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;h3 id="files-in-use-in-the-desktop-app">Files in Use (in the Desktop App)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A frequently expressed wish of our Hub customers: &lt;strong>better support for collaborating on Office files.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While &lt;strong>LibreOffice&lt;/strong>, for example, already has a built-in locking system for open files, this has been missing in &lt;strong>Microsoft Office&lt;/strong> until now. That&amp;rsquo;s why we are currently developing our own &lt;strong>“locking system”&lt;/strong> in the &lt;strong>Cryptomator desktop app&lt;/strong> that recognizes when a file is already open and informs other users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This makes collaborating on documents more conflict-free, transparent, and secure—another step toward smooth teamwork.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="two-years-of-trust-cooperation-and-security">Two Years of Trust, Cooperation, and Security&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In two years, Cryptomator Hub has evolved from an idea into a reliable platform for secure teamwork.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We would like to thank all users, administrators, and testers who have helped to further develop Cryptomator Hub with their feedback—and we look forward to the next chapter.&lt;/p></description><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/11/02/hub-anniversary/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/11/02/hub-anniversary/</guid><category>cryptomator</category><category>hub</category><category>anniversary</category></item><item><title>OneDrive Security Breach Shows: Why Zero-Knowledge Matters</title><description>&lt;p>In &lt;strong>May 2025&lt;/strong>, the &lt;strong>Oasis Security&lt;/strong> published an &lt;a href="https://www.oasis.security/blog/onedrive-file-picker-security-flaw-oasis-research">analysis&lt;/a> that caused a stir in the cloud world: &lt;strong>a vulnerability in OneDrive File Picker&lt;/strong> allowed third-party applications to access files for which they did not actually have access rights. &lt;strong>Millions of users&lt;/strong> were affected, both private individuals and companies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What exactly happened, why is this incident so explosive, and what can you learn from it to better protect your own data?&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="text-center">
&lt;img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src="https://staging.cryptomator.org/img/blog/onedrive-security-breach.png" alt="OneDrive Security Breach Shows: Why Zero-Knowledge Matters" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="what-went-wrong-with-onedrive-file-picker">What Went Wrong With OneDrive File Picker?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>OneDrive File Picker is a popular interface that allows apps to access files from personal cloud storage. However, Oasis Security discovered that &lt;strong>certain configuration&lt;/strong> errors allowed applications to view and download files that they did not officially have access to – even sensitive content such as tax documents, project plans, or confidential meeting minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worse still, the affected applications did not even need to use an exploit – all they had to do was use the File Picker correctly (or rather, incorrectly). &lt;strong>The problem was not a targeted hack, but a design flaw in the system.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-real-lesson-trust-is-not-a-security-concept">The Real Lesson: Trust Is Not a Security Concept&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Many users trust cloud providers such as Microsoft, Google, and Apple to keep their data secure. But this incident shows that even large platforms make mistakes—with far-reaching consequences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>real problem&lt;/strong> runs deeper:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Access rights&lt;/strong> are managed in the backend, not by the user(s) themselves.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Files are often stored &lt;strong>unencrypted&lt;/strong> on servers—or only with a key that the provider itself controls.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Security vulnerabilities in third-party apps or web interfaces&lt;/strong> can be exploited without those affected even noticing.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>In short&lt;/strong>: anyone who entrusts their data exclusively to the security promises of cloud providers is relinquishing control.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-solution-zero-knowledge-encryption-with-cryptomator">The Solution: Zero-Knowledge Encryption With Cryptomator&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cryptomator takes a fundamentally different approach: &lt;strong>files are encrypted locally on your device before being uploaded to the cloud&lt;/strong>. This means your data remains protected even if the cloud provider is compromised—or, as in the case of OneDrive, simply makes a mistake.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This means:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>No one&lt;/strong> but you can read your files—not Microsoft, not Google, not us.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Access rights&lt;/strong> are secondary, because without the key, all data remains unreadable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even &lt;strong>compromised&lt;/strong> APIs or third-party apps only see encrypted garbage data.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cryptomator Hub&lt;/strong> offers the ideal extension for teams, organizations, and companies:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Centralized management of encrypted vaults&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
IT administrators can preconfigure vaults and share them with specific users—all with end-to-end encryption.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Role-based access control&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Thanks to the role-based system, you can specify exactly who is allowed to create, open, or manage vaults—without central key distribution.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Web of trust for secure collaboration&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Team members verify each other, creating a trustworthy environment—without the need for external certificate authorities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Seamless integration into existing cloud workflows&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Cryptomator Hub can be easily combined with existing cloud storage solutions such as OneDrive, Google Drive, or Dropbox.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Cryptomator Hub enables &lt;strong>highly secure and practical cloud usage within teams&lt;/strong> without the usual compromises in data protection and compliance. This is a future-proof solution, especially for organizations with increased requirements, such as &lt;strong>NGOs, research institutions, or companies in regulated industries&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-you-can-do-now">What You Can Do Now&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Whether you use OneDrive, Dropbox, or another cloud service, this incident shows that &lt;strong>no provider can offer 100% security&lt;/strong> on its own. However, you can drastically reduce your risks by taking a few simple steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Use &lt;strong>client-side encryption&lt;/strong> with tools such as Cryptomator.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do not store particularly sensitive documents unencrypted in the cloud.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Raise awareness among your team members&lt;/strong> or colleagues about cloud access rights.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Check which third-party apps have access to your cloud.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion-safety-begins-with-control">Conclusion: Safety Begins With Control&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The OneDrive security breach is not an isolated incident—it is a symptom of a system that relies on trust rather than real control. But if you &lt;strong>encrypt your files before uploading them&lt;/strong>, you remain protected even in the event of serious security breaches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Cryptomator, you retain full control over your data, your privacy, and your digital security.&lt;/p></description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/10/17/onedrive-security-breach/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/10/17/onedrive-security-breach/</guid><category>cryptomator</category><category>onedrive</category></item><item><title>Back to School – Data Security for Universities</title><description>&lt;p>With the start of the new winter semester, lecture halls are filling up again—as are the &lt;strong>digital platforms of universities&lt;/strong>. Learning management systems, research platforms, cloud storage solutions, and digital administrative processes have long been part of everyday life at universities. But while digitalization opens up new opportunities, it also carries risks: &lt;strong>cyberattacks, data breaches, and inadequately protected cloud data&lt;/strong> jeopardize the integrity and confidentiality of highly sensitive information. In this article, we show why encryption is essential for universities – and how it helps make &lt;strong>research, teaching, and administration more secure&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="text-center">
&lt;img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src="https://staging.cryptomator.org/img/blog/back-to-school.png" alt="Back to School – Data Security for Universities" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="why-universities-are-a-lucrative-target-for-cyberattacks">Why Universities Are a Lucrative Target for Cyberattacks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Universities and colleges process a wide range of sensitive data:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Personal data&lt;/strong> of students, researchers, and employees (e.g., student ID numbers, transcripts, health information).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Research data&lt;/strong>, often related to third-party funding or government-funded projects.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>International collaborations&lt;/strong>, which also require compliance with the regulations of other countries (e.g., FERPA, GDPR).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Login details and access keys&lt;/strong> for learning platforms, email services, and digital resources.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>More and more attacks are targeting universities, for example through ransomware, phishing, or cloud leaks. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/Securitysituation/IT-Security-Situation-in-Germany-2024.html">BSI Situation Report 2024&lt;/a>, educational institutions are among the critical areas with a sharply increased threat level. This makes it all the more important for universities to make their digital structures resilient and encrypted.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="encryption-the-universitys-digital-invisible-ink">Encryption: The University’s Digital Invisible Ink&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Data encryption protects information using mathematical methods—it can only be read with the right key. For universities, this means:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Confidentiality of research results&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Particularly in the case of sensitive basic research or cooperation projects with companies, it is crucial that only authorized persons have access to files. End-to-end encryption protects this data even if a cloud provider is compromised.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Data protection for students and teachers&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
The EU GDPR requires universities to comprehensively protect personal data. Encryption enables data processing that complies with data protection regulations—even when using the cloud, working from home, or using BYOD models.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Protection against ransomware and data loss&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Encrypted backups and protected storage systems can greatly limit the impact of ransomware attacks. Attackers have no access to unencrypted original data, and recovery can take place without payment.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/tr>

&lt;td>Zero-knowledge cloud or encrypted vaults&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>

&lt;p>The digitization of higher education is unstoppable—but it is not defenseless. Those who encrypt today will protect the autonomy of research and teaching tomorrow. Universities that rely on simple, secure, and privacy-compliant encryption solutions build trust among students, employees, and partner institutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now is the ideal time to evaluate existing systems, raise awareness, and integrate encryption solutions for the long term.&lt;/p></description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/10/10/back-to-school/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/10/10/back-to-school/</guid><category>cryptomator</category><category>university</category></item><item><title>Cryptomator Desktop 1.18.0 Beta – Try it now!</title><description>&lt;figure class="text-center">
&lt;img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src="https://staging.cryptomator.org/img/blog/desktop-1.18.0-beta.png" alt="Cryptomator Desktop 1.18.0 Beta" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The next release of Cryptomator Desktop is right around the corner – and before we publish the final version, we&amp;rsquo;d like to invite you to test the beta of version 1.18.0. Along with useful new features and important bug fixes, this release also comes with a special call to our community.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-features--fixes">New Features &amp;amp; Fixes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With Cryptomator Desktop 1.18.0, we’re once again bringing improvements and bug fixes across all platforms:&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="new-feature">New Feature&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Remember Last Vault Location&lt;br>
When creating a new vault, Cryptomator will now automatically suggest the last chosen storage location. This makes setup more convenient, especially if you manage multiple vaults in similar folder structures.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="fixes">Fixes&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Linux/KDE: QuickAccess Entries&lt;br>
On KDE, each unlock process created a new QuickAccess entry in the Dolphin file manager, even if one already existed (e.g., after an unexpected app crash). This is now fixed – existing entries are reused, and no manual cleanup is needed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prevention of Huge Log Files&lt;br>
On Windows, log files could in rare cases grow extremely large, causing system issues. The existing size limit of log files was bypassed in those cases. This has been fixed, so the app can safely run in the background without issues.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>macOS: Stability When Saving Vault Passwords&lt;br>
Some users experienced app crashes when trying to save a vault password. This bug has now been fixed, so password saving on macOS works reliably.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>macOS: macFUSE Detection on macOS 26&lt;br>
In the upcoming macOS version 26, macFUSE was sometimes not detected, leading to problems when mounting vaults. This issue is fixed to ensure Cryptomator works smoothly on the latest macOS releases.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div class="text-center">
&lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.18.0-beta1/">&lt;i class="fa-solid fa-download">&lt;/i> Download the Beta 1.18.0 here&lt;/a>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="we-need-your-support">We Need Your Support!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In addition to these updates, there’s something special this time:&lt;br>
Our Windows installer is now signed with a new certificate. Since this certificate is not yet widely recognized in Microsoft’s trust network, Windows may display a security prompt when installing the beta version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The more people install the beta, the faster the certificate will gain trust – and the security dialog will disappear. Don’t worry: the installer is still safe and signed by us. Windows just needs to “learn” that the new certificate is trustworthy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="final-words">Final Words&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With version 1.18.0, we’re making Cryptomator more convenient, stable, and future-proof. The beta is an important step – not only to test the new features and fixes, but also to establish our new certificate in the Windows ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We’re grateful for every bit of support from the community:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Install the beta and try out the updates.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Share your feedback if you notice anything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Help us make the final release as stable and user-friendly as possible.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Your feedback makes Cryptomator stronger – and ensures we can all keep our data securely encrypted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you for your support – we can’t wait for the final release of 1.18.0! 🎉&lt;/p></description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/09/26/desktop-beta-1.18.0/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/09/26/desktop-beta-1.18.0/</guid><category>cryptomator</category><category>desktop</category><category>beta</category></item><item><title>Cryptomator Autumn Sale: Protect Your Data – and Your Wallet!</title><description>&lt;figure class="text-center">

In this article, we outline how this affects Cryptomator and what our plan is to become fully quantum-secure.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cryptographic-breakdown">Cryptographic Breakdown&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the ciphers involved in Cryptomator:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="text-center">
&lt;img class="inline-block rounded-sm" src="https://staging.cryptomator.org/img/blog/traditional-cipher-breakdown.svg" alt="Plot showing the growth of 2^n compared to n^2" />
&lt;figcaption>Cryptographic Breakdown of Cryptomator &amp; Cryptomator Hub&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>As you can see, we mostly rely on AES- and EC-based algorithms. These are traditional algorithms whose security assumptions apply in a world of classical (non-quantum) computers. The general idea is that computations are efficient if you know the right key but practically impossible without. When I say &amp;ldquo;practically impossible&amp;rdquo; I mean on traditional computers, as the computations are just &amp;ldquo;too complex&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-few-words-about-complexity">A Few Words About Complexity&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>While we aim to avoid complexity when it comes to usability or code legibility, there is a specific kind of complexity that we strive for. Let me explain:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we want to express how many steps a certain computation requires, we categorize algorithms into classes of computational complexity. To illustrate this concept, here are some dog-related examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Complexity Class&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Example&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Big O&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Constant Time&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Blowing the dog whistle always takes the same time, regardless of how many dogs are listening.&lt;/td>
&lt;td>O(1)&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Logarithmic Time&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Finding the phone number of a pet clinic is easy with a telephone book, as it&amp;rsquo;s sorted alphabetically and allows you to quickly narrow down the pages.&lt;/td>
&lt;td>O(log n)&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Linear Time&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Petting every dog. If every dog gets the same attention, it takes exactly n times longer, if you have n dogs.&lt;/td>
&lt;td>O(n)&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Polynomial Time&lt;/td>
&lt;td>If every dog at a party wants to sniff and greet every other dog. Dog 1 sniffs dog 2, 3, 4, &amp;hellip; Dog 2 sniffs dog 3, 4, &amp;hellip; and so on.&lt;/td>
&lt;td>O(nᵏ)&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Exponential Time&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Every dog has 4 puppies. That makes 16 dogs after two generations, 64 after three generations and 256 after four generations.&lt;/td>
&lt;td>O(kⁿ)&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>To ensure that breaking a cipher requires an insane amount of time and energy, cryptographic algorithms rely on hard-to-compute problems—i.e., we&amp;rsquo;re operating on the more complex side of the spectrum.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most illustrative example for this is the factorization problem: Determine the prime factors of 8633. The result is easy to verify through a simple multiplication (89 × 97), but finding the factors from the product is hard; &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_number_field_sieve">harder than polynomial but subexponential&lt;/a>. This is exactly what the RSA crypto scheme is based on (except with some &lt;em>very&lt;/em> large numbers), where the public key includes the product of two secret primes that are required to compute the private key.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Quantum computers are not inherently faster, but they allow for a different set of algorithms to run. So, while a problem may be hard-to-compute for traditional algorithms, it could be far less complex when solved with quantum algorithms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the most infamous examples is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor&amp;rsquo;s algorithm&lt;/a>, which solves the factorization problem in polynomial time. While polynomial time is just one row above exponential time in the table above, it makes all the difference. The following graph illustrates the effect of an increasing problem size on the two complexity classes:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="text-center">

&lt;figcaption>Growth curves of polynomial and exponential functions&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>If a quantum computer can be built that is capable of running Shor&amp;rsquo;s algorithm on large numbers, it would break most of today&amp;rsquo;s public-key cryptography—including ECDH.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="symmetric-cryptography">Symmetric Cryptography&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Imagine a number lock with four digits. To guess the correct combination, a traditional computer would have to check every possibility, starting with 0000 and ending with 9999. On average, it would take 5,000 guesses. Now, what if I told you that a quantum computer could do it in just 100 guesses? Sounds like magic? That is exactly what Grover&amp;rsquo;s algorithm can achieve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More generally, when a traditional algorithm takes \(n/2\) steps on average, a quantum computer only needs \(\sqrt n\) attempts—a speed-up that the BBBV theorem proves to be the best possible solution. If you want to understand how this works, there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQWpF2Gb-gU">a great video by 3Blue1Brown about Grover&amp;rsquo;s Algorithm&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This &amp;ldquo;magic&amp;rdquo; applies to any problem where it&amp;rsquo;s efficient to check if a guessed solution is correct. That&amp;rsquo;s obviously a problem if you don&amp;rsquo;t want an attacker to guess your secret key. Fortunately, the defense is simple: increase \(n\) to a size where even \(\sqrt n\) becomes large enough to make Grover&amp;rsquo;s algorithm impractical.&lt;/p>

&lt;span>Why is AES-256 quantum-secure?&lt;/span>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="admonition-content">
&lt;p>Ever wondered why we use AES-256 instead of AES-128?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;256&amp;rdquo; refers to the number of key bits, resulting in \(2^{256}\) possible keys. Guessing the correct key would therefore take \(2^{256} / 2 = 2^{255}\) attempts on a traditional computer and \(\sqrt{2^{256}} = 2^{128}\) attempts using Grover&amp;rsquo;s algorithm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Making \(2^{128}\) guesses is simply unfeasible. So, while AES-128 suffices on traditional computers, the post-quantum world demands for AES-256.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>So, while a sufficiently large key space is enough for AES, our asymmetric ciphers need to be replaced to withstand attacks from quantum computers. In 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) launched a competition to identify quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Electing algorithms through a competition has already proven successful in the past, as with AES and SHA-3. This approach attracts significant attention from experts, who do their best to uncover weaknesses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2022, after several rounds of eliminating dozens of candidates, NIST &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/07/nist-announces-first-four-quantum-resistant-cryptographic-algorithms">announced the winners&lt;/a>. Kyber and Dilithium—named after crystals from Star Wars and Star Trek, respectively—became the first standardized post-quantum algorithms for encryption and digital signatures. They were officially named ML-KEM and ML-DSA.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;p>Great! So let&amp;rsquo;s integrate ML-KEM and ML-DSA into Cryptomator Hub:&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;But wait, there is still ECDH in it!?&amp;rdquo; I hear you say. And you&amp;rsquo;re right. Despite the new ciphers being very promising, we have to face the fact that they simply haven&amp;rsquo;t been around for long. We just don&amp;rsquo;t know yet what kinds of attacks might be discovered in the future—or whether these algorithms will truly stand the test of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, to be extra cautious, we combine a traditional cipher and a post-quantum one. Think of it like a door with two locks: if one is broken, the other still protects what&amp;rsquo;s inside. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple design that ensures the system is no weaker than its individual components. This post-quantum/traditional (PQ/T) hybrid is called &lt;em>X-Wing&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>X-Wing is still a work in progress, but I reached out to the RFC authors—Deirdre Connolly, Peter Schwabe, and Bas Westerbaan—to ask when we can expect the final specification to be published. Just ten minutes later, Bas replied:&lt;/p>

&lt;span>If PQ/T hybrids are preferable, what about a hybrid signature scheme?&lt;/span>

&lt;p>Yes, there are also &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-prabel-jose-pq-composite-sigs/02/">efforts to standardize a combination of ML-DSA and ECDSA&lt;/a>. Other than X-Wing, this is in an earlier phase, though. We are closely following developments in this area and will probably make use of this scheme once it is ready.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="standardizing-cryptography">Standardizing Cryptography&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="benefits-of-standardization">Benefits of Standardization&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In every industry, standardization plays a key role. It ensures compatibility, promotes interoperability, and reduces costs by enabling different systems and organizations to work together using common protocols and specifications—maintaining consistency and reliability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the security sector, standardization is even more critical. Algorithms, protocols, and data formats must not only function reliably across heterogeneous systems—they must also withstand rigorous scrutiny. The more experts peer review a standard, the better. As with the NIST competitions mentioned earlier, such scrutiny can uncover weaknesses &lt;em>before&lt;/em> a cipher is deployed in production. By adhering to established, transparent standards, both developers and users benefit from stronger, more trustworthy protection—especially as the threat landscape evolves with technologies like quantum computing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ignoring such standards—sometimes in the name of speed or convenience—sets you on a path that may be paved with hidden flaws. Even the smallest change can introduce serious vulnerabilities that, without thorough peer reviews, are likely to be discovered first by someone smarter and less well-intentioned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At Cryptomator, we&amp;rsquo;ve always stood against &amp;ldquo;security through obscurity&amp;rdquo; (which is also &lt;a href="https://staging.cryptomator.org/guides/open-source/">why open source matters&lt;/a>). Needless to say, we&amp;rsquo;ve never used home-cooked ciphers—that would pose a serious risk. And the more widely used an algorithm or protocol is, the easier it becomes to understand, verify, and audit the system as a whole.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="a-strong-foundation">A Strong Foundation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Many standards are built upon others. Without ML-KEM, there would be no X-Wing. Now that X-Wing is around the corner, what can we do with it? Use it in yet another standard: &lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9180.html">HPKE&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>HPKE stands for Hybrid Public Key Encryption—and to be precise, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t depend on X-Wing at all. Instead, it defines how to combine three different cryptographic ingredients—KEM, KDF, and AEAD—in a specific way that ensures well-defined security properties. And X-Wing can serve as one of these ingredients (the KEM).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another standard that we&amp;rsquo;ve come to love is JWE, a data format for exchanging encrypted payloads. And guess what—there are people working on &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-reddy-cose-jose-pqc-hybrid-hpke-07">standardizing the use of X-Wing-based HPKE in JWE&lt;/a>. That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what we want to adopt in Cryptomator Hub, replacing the current ECDH-based JWEs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond the aforementioned benefits of peer reviews, adopting standardized formats over proprietary ones provides several additional advantages:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Common APIs make it easy to swap out implementations—for example, HPKE usage remains the same regardless of the underlying algorithms.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wide availability of well-established libraries. For instance, there are dozens of JWE/JWT libraries.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Official test vectors allows us to write tests that fail the build early if something goes wrong.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Faster vulnerabilities awareness: If a flaw is discovered in a widely used standard, it will likely be reported quickly—whereas a single proprietary implementation may go unnoticed for much longer.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Both JWE and HPKE support interchangeable internal algorithms while maintaining a consistent external interface. This allows us to retain the overall structure and quickly replace internal components if vulnerabilities arise.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The moral is the need for cryptographic agility. It’s not enough to implement a single standard; it’s vital that our systems be able to easily swap in new algorithms when required.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So, if all the ciphers used in Cryptomator products—as well as the exchange of secrets in Cryptomator Hub—are based on standards, what about the vault format?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While we use well-established cryptography, the file formats themselves are our own. But we want to change that. Some time ago, we joined forces with developers of Cyberduck, gocryptfs, and rclone to derive a common format for encrypted directories—ensuring interoperability across our tools. Although the format is still a work in progress, we hope to share more details with you in a couple of months. In the meantime, you&amp;rsquo;re of course invited to review the format and contribute ideas for improvement on &lt;a href="https://github.com/encryption-alliance/unified-vault-format">GitHub&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One key benefit of this &lt;em>Unified Vault Format&lt;/em> is that it enables key rotation—which itself brings two major advantages:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Access revocation&lt;/strong>: After rotating keys, former vault members can no longer decrypt files added after their access got revoked. What is trivial with access control lists requires special care when we want to enforce this cryptographically.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Cipher agility&lt;/strong>: To some extent, it enables cipher upgrades. For example, if a vulnerability is found in one algorithm, we can flip a switch and transition to a new JWE algorithm—instantly protecting all newly added files.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;h3 id="cryptomator-hub">Cryptomator Hub&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Cryptomator Hub, on the other hand, will need to migrate to different algorithms. These are the steps we want to take:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;em>(In progress)&lt;/em> Implement X-Wing: As a 100% open-source company, we have always contributed to other libraries and projects. As mentioned before, we&amp;rsquo;re in contact with the authors of the &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-connolly-cfrg-xwing-kem/">X-Wing RFC&lt;/a> and also with the JDK security team in order to add &lt;a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/pull/26032">X-Wing support in the OpenJDK&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>(In progress)&lt;/em> Implement HPKE in JWE libraries: We have been contributing to one of the most widely used &lt;a href="https://connect2id.com/products/nimbus-jose-jwt">JOSE libraries for Java&lt;/a> from the very beginning of Cryptomator. Unsurprisingly, it is therefore in our interest to add HPKE support (and then X-Wing based HPHKE) as defined in &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-reddy-cose-jose-pqc-hybrid-hpke-07">JOSE HPKE RFC&lt;/a>. The RFC authors (one of whom we know personally) are already eager to hear our feedback.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Migrate the JWEs used in Cryptomator Hub from traditional to PQ/T hybrid cryptography. We want to start this as soon as the standards are finalized and the aforementioned algorithm implementations can be published in upstream libraries.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Introduce a new vault format that will improve the cipher agility and has further benefits for Cryptomator Hub users.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>As you can see this is a collaborative effort. All to build a resilient foundation for the years ahead.&lt;/p></description><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/07/24/post-quantum-roadmap/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://staging.cryptomator.org/blog/2025/07/24/post-quantum-roadmap/</guid><category>cryptomator</category><category>encryption</category></item></channel></rss>
